She tells me that those who\npurchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no\ngreyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers\nwho are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For those\nwho don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi \nor greyscale (at 300dpi).\n\nIf the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their\nhardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance \n1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).\n\nRegards,\n\nGlenn\n\nP.S. - personally, I'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  They\nreally have an obligation to provide this information to all\nof the customers who purchased the 600 in the original \nconfiguration (they have the records...that's why they ask for\nthings like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed, \nI'm going to write Apple and complain.\n"

19 b'From: jca2@cec1.wustl.edu (Joseph Charles Achkar)\nSubject: Blues into playoffs, beat TB 6-5\nKeywords: Blues, Shanahan, Joseph, Hull, Minnesota, TB\nNntp-Posting-Host: cec1\nOrganization: Washington University, St. Louis MO\nLines: 127\n\nBy Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\n\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\n\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\nWith the North Stars\' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I\'m glad I didn\'t see it go in at the end," Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\'s anger.\n\n``It wasn\'t pretty at the end," he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\'t have, but\nit did."\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\'s end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It\'s a shame we let down," said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\'d have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy."\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that\'s all that matters," said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play."\n\nSome players didn\'t have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\'t quit," said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan\'t allow five goals like we did, that\'s not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on."\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\'s loss.\n\n``I didn\'t know it was final," he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\'re in the playoffs,\nand that\'s great, but it\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend."\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn\'t want to see the score, I didn\'t want to know the score,"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\'s the approach we took."\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver," Bassen said. ``He\'s in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he\'s happy."\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\'s shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\'s second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there," Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in."\n\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \n  %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \n  *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \n  %     \\    ________/                                                   *\n  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \n  %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *\n  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*% \n'

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your\ncalculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is\n307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I\ndon't think it is a BIOS mode.

Is this true?\n\nI own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \n  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\n\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with\n  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly\n  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\n\nMy last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like\n  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded\n  like new.\n\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\n\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.\n\n--\n***********************************************************************\n**    Alan Webber                                                    **\n**                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                                                                   **\n** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **\n** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **\n** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **\n** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    **\n***********************************************************************\n"

I am more used to\nthe dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean\nand reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike\nis part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do\nI remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without\nscrewing it down before reading?\n\nThe service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on\nthe head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do\nyou know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?\n\nMy headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter\nreplacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?\n\nAs always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia\nhas finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the riders\nALL waved.

A max of 65K\n   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB\n   VRAM.\n\n2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:\n\n   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an\n      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often\n      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to\n      be.\n\n   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the\n      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you\n      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).\n\n3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development\n   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\n   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The\n   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.\n\n   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen\n   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter\n   "R". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it\n   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn\'t have to do this.\n\n   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive\n   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with\n   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles\n   the VGA mode.\n   \n   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use\n   another monitor in place of my usual one.\n\nI still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be\nremedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).\n\n---\nswh, 20apr93\n'

The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.

It is most likely that in the\nfuture possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession\nof \'terrorist and drug dealers tools\', and be some serious Fedaral Felony.\nJust like common tools are \'burgular tools\' if the police say so, common\ncomputer programs (even computers themselves) are now \'hackers tools\',\nand will become \'terrorist tools\'.  BET ON IT.\n\nThe insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important.\nIf the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states\nas far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned,\nthe rest of the world (remember \'New World Order\'?) will not be far\nbehind - only a few years.\n\nPlease keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens\nones rights in this thing.\n\nFor example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer\nbe private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready\nis very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to\ndecide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes\nguilty of \'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means\'.  The\nphrase \'illegal means\' is defined as whatever the government wants it\nto be defined as.\n\nCouple this with Clinton\'s pressing for a \'smart\' National ID card (an\n\'Internal passport\'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and\nyour past can be put on it, and you can only take the government\'s\nword as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones\nwith the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn\'t\nthat nice?\n\nWhile the Feds can bust into one\'s safe without the keys, the owner\nknows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your \'secure\'\nphone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)\nyou have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has\ngone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they\ncan get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to\na safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption:\nRecord everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys\nobtained from the suspect.\n\nThis Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any\npriviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful\npolitical dissent virtually impossible.

Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\nterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\nArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\nvery lives.\n\tI mention this not because I\'m anti semitic [I\'m part\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\nIsraelites pisses me off so.

Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if\nwe had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the\nproblem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.\n\nRight now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity.\nThere are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can\'t buy\nProton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to\nhelp a great deal but it can\'t right now.

(BTW, sometimes it seems that our government \nis trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be\npainless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to\nhelp when they *have* the \'proper\' government.  They\'ll never\nget there without the aid.  It may be too late already.\n\n>\n>>BTW, who is to decide \'stupid?\'  This is just like those who\n>>want to impose their \'morals\' on others -- just the sort of\n>>thing I thought Libertarians were against.\n>\n>That was an opinion, and libertarians are very big on free speech.\n\nAnd I\'m just excercising mine.\n\n>\n>>Actually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue \n>>and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.

I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

The article starts with "A leader\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\nbe impossible." O\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\nmeaningful research "is a real question for me."\nO\'Connor said "everything is fair game," including\n"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\nmanned space shuttle fleet."\n\nO\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\ninto three categories based on cost.\n\nThe Post says O\'Connor described the design derived\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\nlistened in on part of O\'Connor\'s briefing to the press\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\'Connor\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\nCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\'Connor say\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\nthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).\n\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\nas "one features modules that could gradually be fitted\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."\n\nThe last sentence in the article contradicts the title\n& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He\n[O\'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned\nspace station Freedom is still possible within the\nadministration\'s budget guidelines."\n\n'

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn\'t be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\'ll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\'d bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn\'t give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\'d\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\nbody produced, how much lunar material it\'d need for protection from solar\nflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don\'t remember the name of this magazine. \nDoes this ring a bell to anyone?\n\nCraig Keithley                    |"I don\'t remember, I don\'t recall, \nApple Computer, Inc.              |I got no memory of anything at all"\nkeithley@apple.com                |Peter Gabriel, Third Album (1980)\n'

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission.

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

Does anyone know \nhow much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while\nbolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track\nand erected on the pad?  \n\nThey would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads \n(unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course\nany Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the\nUS at great cost.

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in\nhassles.\n\nThe important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to\nthe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically\ndown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any\nnew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --\nthe actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,\nyou *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns\nand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.\n\nThe major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for\nmore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.\nFor what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop\na new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper\nmight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less\nambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing\nsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting\nmoney in a big way.\n\nGiven this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a\nminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which\ndominates the cost of the project.\n-- \nAll work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which\n    much of the net community has settled. Please DON\'T bring them up again\n    unless there\'s something truly new to be discussed. The net can\'t set\n    public policy, that\'s what your representatives are for.\n\n\n    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS\n\n    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints\n    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\n    microfilm.\n\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\'s vintage hardware (like\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\n    from.\n\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\n    sheet design.\n\n\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\n\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\n    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently\n    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early\n    in a mission.\n\n\n    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES\n\n    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to\n    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium\n    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\n\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\n    pursue are:\n\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\n    Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\n    Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good\n    article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo\'s launch,\n    "Showdown at Pad 39-B," by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November\n    1989 issue of *Ad Astra*.

Hanson, editor; DOE Document No.  DOE/TIC-22800;\n    Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1980.)\n\n\n    IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER\n\n    From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from\n    the Space Shuttle\'s Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible\n    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\n    study, Charles Jackman.\n\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\n\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\n\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Shuttle sources:\t  725,000 kilograms/year\n\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\n\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\n\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\n    do at the present time.\n\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\n    Shuttle\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\n\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\n    you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\n\n    References:\n\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\n    Alfred G. Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).\n\n    _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.\n    Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\n\n\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\n\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\n    team\'s medical/forensic report.\n\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\n\n\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\n\n    You can\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\n    because it can\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\n    specialized for travel between Earth\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\n    spacecraft.\n\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\n\n\n    THE "FACE ON MARS"\n\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\n\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\'t\n    know the address) to study the Face.\n\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\n    sci.astro.\n\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

Long term the laserprinter \nwill need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that \nare the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.\n\nHP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the \nsoftware package has no inkjet driver. \n\nThere is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a \npage printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a \nlaserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot.

We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\'ve ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\'ll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\n\n\nDan Snodgrass\nMedia Services\nLewis & Clark College\nPortland\n'

It gives the nicest outputs, with only\na minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters,\nresumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to\nlook a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one\ngrudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the\npresence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However,\nyou would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.\n\nThe cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as\nmuch support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets.\nAlso HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe\nthat the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).\n\nIf you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say\nfountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain\n(I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9\nmonths). \n\n\t-Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer\n\t\t  very much!)\n\nPS: I have a question for you netters, I'm too afraid to refill with\nthe waterproof inks they sell in art-supply houses because I had brought\na bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge. I\nwonder what is a 'good' waterproof ink (aside from buying refill-kits)\nto refill my cartridge?\n\n\n\n\n"

In practice, they are not."\n>"You mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision\n> revised?!?!"\n\n\nAll right.  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I\'ll give \nyour question a shot. \n\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \npages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not \ntoner.  But that should go without saying.\n\nMy PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little \nwhile to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once \nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \n\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I\'m assuming that the DeskJet can, or \nHP wouldn\'t sell many......\n\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \nlike a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.\n\nFinally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200\'s resolution.  It looks like \na good laser quality print.  The HP\'s I\'ve used.....they look like ink.  Not \nas impressive.  \n\nSo, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?\n'

OldPos 251 | 8 b'From: jrutledg@cs.ulowell.edu (John Lawrence Rutledge)\nSubject: Re: Some more about gun control...\nOrganization: Interactive Media Group - University of Massachusetts at Lowell\nLines: 146\n\nIn article <1993Apr16.010235.14225@mtu.edu>, cescript@mtu.edu (Charles Scripter) writes:\n-> > This mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me.  According\n-> > to the Federalist Paper\'s, a well regulated militia has a well defined \n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\n-> \n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\n\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\n"well regulated malitia."  Here is what is says about its character:\n\n\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\n\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\n\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\n\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\n\t character of a well-regulated militia, \n\nIt also talks about the "well regulated militia" having a nationally\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \n\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\n\n    \tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n\ta year.\n\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \n\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\na "well regulated militia" is not well organized.  But I will concide \na "well organized militia" is not necessarily a "well regulated militia." \n\nSeveral people have stated that the "well organized militia" is\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\n\n\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \n\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \n\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \n\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \n\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \n\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \n\tNational Guard.\n\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective "well regulated."\n10 USC 311 does not define a "well regualed militia" in any way, shape, \nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the "well regualed militia" as a\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\ntalk above "disciplining all the militia of the United States" so they\nfit the "character of a well-regulated militia."  This is what the\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\n\n\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \n\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \n\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \n\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \n\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \n\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\n\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \n\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\n\n\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the "General Welfare" clause): \n\t"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n\trecital of particulars."\n\nSo the phrase "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \nnot be infringed" must either qualify or explain the phrase "a well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state."  \nThe definition of "explain" as stated in "The American Hertitage\nDictionary of the Enlish Language" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\n\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\n\t   elucidate: "It was the economists who undertook to explain \n\t   this puzzle"\n\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\n\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for\' justify:\n\t   explain an error\nThe second phrase clearly does not "explain" the first, therefore\nthe second phrase must "qualify" the first.  The definition given\nfor "qualify" is:\n\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\n\t   of; characterize.\n\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \n\t   task.\n\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\n\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\n\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\n\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\nSince "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, "the right \nof the people to keep and bear Arms" gives legal power to the "well \nregualated militia" and this legal power "shall not be infringed".  \n\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \npeople\'s right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \nabout the right of an untrained person to "keep and bear" a .50 caliber\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\nme.\n\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\n\nI mean "to destory our Liberties and Rights."  Is that why a participate\nin the discussion of exactly what "our Libertues and Rights" are?  I \nforce my version of "our Liberties and Rights" by begining statements\nof what "our Liberties and Rights" with "All that the Second Amendment \nclearly states to me."   Using expressions, such as "states to me," \nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don\'t think so.\n\nSo in effort not to force my views and not "to destory our Liberties and\nRights,"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\nthe matter of "Liberties and Rights" is the final word.  For I am only\none person among many and the final word on "Liberties and Rights" cleary\nand irrevocably belongs to the many.\n \n+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                             |  "If only it were a modern document, with a   |\n| John Lawrence Rutledge      | smart index and hyper links stretching all    |\n| Research Assistant          | through the world data net.

And I have also stated that a militia that\nmeets once or twice a year is clearly "well organized."  And this\nstate of readiness that I have claimed the people have a "right"\nto, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated\nby Hamilton. \n\n\n-- \n+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                             |  "If only it were a modern document, with a   |\n| John Lawrence Rutledge      | smart index and hyper links stretching all    |\n| Research Assistant          | through the world data net.

It\n-> asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for\n-> maintaining a milita. \n-> a free state.\n\nYes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun \nmilitia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how "well regulated" \nmodifies "militia" is:\n\tto qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, "wet"\n\tmodifes "day" in the phrase "a wet day."\n\nThe amendment is similiar to the statement:\n\tA wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep\n\tand wear boots, shall not be infringed.\nSo how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar,\nwhat does the "unorganized militia" have to due with the right to\nown guns?\n\n-> The sentence [in the Second Amendment] doesn\'t restrict the right, or\n-> state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other\n-> than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a\n-> right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,\n-> Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.\n-> The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the\n-> amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right\n-> to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of\n-> In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and\n-> bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.\n\nNo not, unconditional, but "shall not be infringed".  Infringed\nis defined as:\n\tTo break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath, \n\tan agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.\n\tTo go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.\nThis definition implies the following of some form of existing \nagreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries \nor limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word \n"unconditional" implies no agreements or all previous agreements \nare off, which is the opposite.\n\nThe words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,\n"congress shall make no law," are much stronger.  They clearly \n\t         ^^^^^^^^^^^\nimply "unconditional."  If the writers of the amendment, wanted \nunconditional whay didn\'t they says, "congress shall make no \nlaws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms"?\nThe second amendment implies a sort contract between the people\nthe people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is\nthe people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws\nat any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped\nthe people from forming a "well regutaled militia."  The duties\nof a "well regulated militia" to the government are descussed in \nFederalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control\nof the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II \nSection 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution.\n\n-- \n+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                             |  "If only it were a modern document, with a   |\n| John Lawrence Rutledge      | smart index and hyper links stretching all    |\n| Research Assistant          | through the world data net.

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\n\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you\'re\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\naccelerator.\n\nPaul\n'

Hearts are often favored for this, as it contains the spirit.\n\nHave you ever read or seen "Alive", which is the story of the Argentinian boys\nsoccer team that crashed in the Andes and then ate the bodies of those who died\nin order to survive?  Finger lickin good.  How about the Twighlight Zone\nepisode "To Serve Man"?\n\nIf you want more info on this, a good place to start is on sci.anthropology\n\nNow send me $20 and eat my flesh,\n\nDan\nlovall@physics.purdue.edu\n\n\n\n\n'

This is a fact about an abstract model\nof what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.\nThis abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*\nof the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put\naside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)\n\nI\'m not saying that the programmer\'s perspective is evil or stunted. After\nall, that\'s what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully\ndistinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must\nultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. \n\n\n   I don\'t recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be\n   categorized as a "symbol manipulator".\n\nIt would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this\nclaim. At any rate, I don\'t think this is evidence that 20% of users think\nlike programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---\nthese are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol\nmanipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not\nrequired to do what they do. \n\nTo restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;\nno, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.\n'

Anthony Fauci, director of the \nU.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, \n"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly \ncan with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will \nget around microbial resistance."  He said any delay would signify questions \nover safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co-\nauthored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the  \nargument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery \nindicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of time \nand money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were \ninfected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of \nVirginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument \nfor  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the \nnew information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand \nthe significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  "We\'ve known about this \nfor five years, but we\'re  glad it is now in the public domain," said Jesse \nDobson of the  California-based Project Inform.

This finding \nsupports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of \ncontracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the \nJAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive \nsurgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies \nwere conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and \nFlorida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and \ntested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found \nthat none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  \nHIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.

The Florida researchers, led by \nGordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said, \n"This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general \ndentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal \nprecautions are strictly observed."

A6 \n======================================================================   \n"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program" AIDS \nTreatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) \n\n     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of \nHealth has raised questions about the NIH\'s commitment to an  effort that uses \nunorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  "They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS," she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists\' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, "The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research."   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, "Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It\'s only fair to give the \nOffice time to gel, but  it\'s up to the public to insist that it\'s much, much \nmore [than  public relations]." \n======================================================================   \n"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \n\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\n6 can attack the human immune system\'s natural killer cells.  This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system\'s fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso\'s research  \nfound that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, \nwhich is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nkill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso\'s  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso\'s  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV\'s attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley\'s editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book "Earth in the \nBalance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as "a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS." \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial "is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick."  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  "This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines," said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID\'s division of AIDS.  "We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children." \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID\'s division of AIDS. \n\n"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another," said Dr. McNamara.  "We\'ll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects."   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV\'s surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \nbe told what they receive. \n\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \nbegin. \n\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \n\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals\' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were "turned \non," or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals\' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \ninfection or AIDS. \n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \nSan Francisco General Hospital. \n     Secretary Shalala said, "One goal of this project is to share expertise \nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience." \n     Secretary Shalala said, "This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available." \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient\'s HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA\'s Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     "When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients," said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  "This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve." \n     "This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management," said HRSA\'s associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  "Providers who treat people with \nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS." \n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \n\n\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\n\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\n\x0c\n------------- cut here -----------------\n-- This is the last part ---------------\n\n---\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\n'

I will not use styrofoam table service.\nPlease keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack\nenvironmentalism)\n\nA half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will\nrarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more\npowerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.\n\nSatan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something\nother than God\'s intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the\nhealth of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You\nthink he\'s going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected,\nit is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is\nnot God\'s intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is\nGod.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.\n\nI see two facets of a response to it:\n\n1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is\n   God\'s intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because\n   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not\n   constitute what the Apostle Paul called "becoming all things to all men so\n   that by all possible means I might save some."\n\n   Don\'t say "Forget the environment, I\'ve got important things to spend my time\n   on." - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your\n   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.\n\n2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not\n   creator.  Show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and\n   glory.  Show that it is not the ultimate tapestry, but one of many cords\n   woven in the infinite tapestry.\n\n################################################################################\n# "God, give me mountains # "But the greatest   # Jonathan Hayward             #\n# to climb and the        # of these is love."  # Jonathan_Hayward@wheaton.edu #\n# strength for climbing." # I Corinthians 13:13 # jhayward@imsa.edu            #\n################################################################################\n'

At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I\nhad with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with\nCD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a\nmajor way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver\n(I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this\nuntil I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now\nfind that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled\ncorrectly by the ASW-410 driver.\n\nSo, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their\nFAX number?\n\nAny assistance appreciated.\n\nRegards\n\nBTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with\n     the rest with the 641.\n-- \n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  Nigel Harwood  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n<< Post:  Coles Supermarkets, PO Box 480 Glen Iris 3146, Australia >>\n<< Phone: +61 3 829 6090  E-mail: nigel@cnw01.storesys.coles.oz.au >>\n<<   FAX: +61 3 829 6886                                           >>\n"

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

I played\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \n\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \n\n*********************************************************\n\n- All prices include shipping.\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\n- US buyers only please.\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\n  priority USPS.\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\nget the game.

This means that Saturn doesn\'t give up\nthe profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-\ncar profits.

Oh wait, you\nchose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact \nOPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don\'t think that it\'s\nbecause it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was\nEgypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs\nwho refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET\nBY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli\nshipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response\nto years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan\nHeights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel\nfinally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that \nthe borders could be expanded.\n \n   Steve\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|   Internet: aa229@freenet.carleton.ca              Fidonet: 1:163/109.18   |\n|             Mossad@qube.ocunix.on.ca                                       |\n|    <<My opinions are not associated with anything, including my head.>>    |\n'

So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\n##it)?  \n##\n\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\nscience.

I got it from\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\neditor.\n\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\n\n    The Patron of Youth\n\n\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\n    the manner expected.\n\n    Saint Aloysius\' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\n    more than his father.\n\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father\'s\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\n\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\n\n    He wanted to share Our Lord\'s suffering to\tshow  his  reciprocal\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\n\n\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\tIgna-\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\n\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\n\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\n\n    The Marquis\' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\n    son:  "Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\n    ness?" "I will not, father," was the  in-evitable  reply.\t"Then\n    leave from my sight and don\'t return until you change your mind!"\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\tpray:\n    "Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!" He knelt down\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\n    this  time\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. "The Lord wants him,\n    the Lord can have him." He gave his consent for his son to become\n    a Jesuit.\n\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\n    the dying for a holy death.\n\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\tcarrying  and\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul\tto  the  Lord\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\n\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\n\n    - Brendan Arthur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\n\nGod Bless\n\nFrom Simon\nLines:  106\n-- \n/----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\\\n|  Simon P.

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\n\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you\'re\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\naccelerator.\n\nPaul\n'

The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.

When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the line\nthat installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility.\nIt replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes the\nversion of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably the\nImage version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however,\ninstall smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:\n   1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.\n       i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?\n   2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?\n       I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I\n       erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected.\n\nFrom the experiments I have run, The two programs (Erase Protect and\nsmart Erase) don't use each others info.\nI currently have both EP and smartcan loading within my autoexec, and\nI don't see any conflicts;\n\nFYI :  Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.2\n       Norton Util's version 6\n\nThanks for any help.\n"

Of course, I said "No problem" and went to work.\nUnfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during \ninstallation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using\nthe old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit \nSeagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted \nwith DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if \nI could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition \nwas intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn\'t think you could go over a\n32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried \nto remove the primary partition, which it wouldn\'t allow me to do.

Others claim to be staying of their own free\nwill, but Jobs\' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.\n\nIn conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting\ninformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the\nindustry.  At times, he has claimed to "have hardware which will blow\nanything else away", while more recently he claims they have stopped\nmanufacturing their own.\n\nAgents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is\nequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and\npossibly Canon equipment.\n\nThe siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to\nother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as "Bill" and\nclaims to be the "MS-iah".\n\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\n"interpersonal computing" which rejects traditional roles.\n\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\nfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares\nthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own\napocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers\ncarry Jobs\' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling "I\nwant to welcome you to the \'Next World\' ".\n\n- - -- \nRoland J.

The attempts to quiet any violence\n    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder\n    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and\n    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\n\n\n>The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population\n>density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.\n>The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\n>Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\n>strip and seek work in Israel.\n\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\n    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to\n    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\n    racist ommission on your part.\n\n\n>While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\n>Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\n>the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\n>Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\n>\n>The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is\n>recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of\n>justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to\n>rise up against its tormentors.\n\n    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is\n    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have\n    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave\n    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the\n    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing\n    but an anti-Israel charade.\n\n\n>As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of\n>Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are\n>considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops\n>and fields. \n\n    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli\n    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials\n    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your\n    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan\n    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as\n    collaborators.\n\n\n\t     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in\n>Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for\n>the Master Race.\n\n    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you\n    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of\n    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the\n    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have   \n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \n    \n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \n    race,' for you to avoid...\n\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\n    in Lebanon.  \n\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\n\n\n>The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the\n>right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the\n>occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some\n>Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over\n>Gaza through Arab collaborators.\n\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\n    manner.\n\n\n>As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible\n>with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming\n>Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for\n>self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish\n>society does not consider Gazans full human beings. \n\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is\n    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had\n    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land\n    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS\n    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a \n    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do\n    continuously refer to international law, would you please say\n    what specific international laws Israel is violating?  \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   This attitude\n>is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. \n\n    I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.\n\n\n>                                                             The\n>current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are\n>consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister\n>Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. \n\n    Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he\n    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll\n    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort\n    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.\n\n\n>                                           One is led to ask\n>oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister\n>goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution\n>up their sleeve ?\n\n    Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually\n    dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what\n    you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.\n\n\n>I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever\n>they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and\n>political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.\n\n    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,\n    or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \n\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe\n    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born\n    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is\n    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \n    appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other \n    people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do \n    some good.\n \n    But for now, you are a fruad.\n\n\n \n"

The former is used on passports\n|> etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\n|> am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\n|> times and present them at many public places, almost every day.\n|> These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\n|> You maintain that this mainly because of religious services\n|> provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\n|> serves no other purpose ?\n\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\n\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\'um field might\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\n\n\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\'s borders were\n|> \'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\'. According to what I\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\n|> Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\n|> Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel\'s borders, when Israel was\n|> established, as this might restrict Israel\'s opportunities for\n|> later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\n|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\n|> land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\n|> promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\n|> borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\n|> today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can\'t it declare what\n|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\n|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\n\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from "Israeli expansionism".\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\'t is aware of it.\n\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\nand sensible.\n\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\n|> official. I don\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\n|> Vanunu\'s revelations about Israel\'s nuclear arsenal without\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\n|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\n\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a "center for\npolicy research".  Whether or not all of Vanunu\'s revelations were true has no\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing "state secrets"\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\nAs to which were and which weren\'t, I am under no moral obligation\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\nconcept of "Secrets of state", something which every democratic govt\nhas.\n\n|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\n|> \'hidden prisoners\' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\n|> Ma\'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\n|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\n\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\n\n|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\n|> way to \'cast aspersions upon Israel\'.

This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\n\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\nquestions are often termed "tabloid journalism" and are not\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\n\nMy answers were not any more "hysterical" than the questions\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q\'s were provocative,\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\nfall into the same category of those who seek "yes" "no" answers\nwhen the real answer is "of sorts".\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\nthem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look\nYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated\nculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they\nhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment\nthey sought to protect.

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

The article starts with "A leader\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\nbe impossible." O\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\nmeaningful research "is a real question for me."\nO\'Connor said "everything is fair game," including\n"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\nmanned space shuttle fleet."\n\nO\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\ninto three categories based on cost.\n\nThe Post says O\'Connor described the design derived\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\nlistened in on part of O\'Connor\'s briefing to the press\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\'Connor\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\nCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\'Connor say\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\nthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).\n\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\nas "one features modules that could gradually be fitted\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."\n\nThe last sentence in the article contradicts the title\n& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He\n[O\'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned\nspace station Freedom is still possible within the\nadministration\'s budget guidelines."\n\n'

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents\' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe\'re going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t\nsustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let\'s not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\n\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\n\n\n'

OldPos 3 | 6 b'From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office \nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 71\n\nI have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\'d GIF images contain charts outlining\none of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in\nCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.

However, the rumors\n>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\n>seems more likely.\n\nYo Ken, let\'s keep on-top of things! Both the "External Tank" and\n"Wingless Orbiter" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the "giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles," and building a "station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed."\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday\'s Times).\n\nOption "A" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\'s\n     qualified for STS and ELV\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption "B" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options "A" and "B".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.\n\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\ncylinder that\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\n  - 7 berthing ports\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\n  - increased crew time for utilization\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\n'

Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn\'t be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\'ll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\'d bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn\'t give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\'d\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\nbody produced, how much lunar material it\'d need for protection from solar\nflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don\'t remember the name of this magazine. \nDoes this ring a bell to anyone?\n\nCraig Keithley                    |"I don\'t remember, I don\'t recall, \nApple Computer, Inc.              |I got no memory of anything at all"\nkeithley@apple.com                |Peter Gabriel, Third Album (1980)\n'

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn\'s rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole\n    in the summer of 1993.

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]\n\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\'s idea -- Any Takers?\n'

But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars\nin hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop\nyour own launch system, charging its entire development cost against\nyour contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.

But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on\nexactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project\nstart to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,\nthe target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want\nspeed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in\nservice as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less\nthan 18 months after the development go-ahead.\n\nOne of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief\nthat you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending\nbillions of dollars.  It isn't true and never was.\n"

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in\nhassles.\n\nThe important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to\nthe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically\ndown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any\nnew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --\nthe actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,\nyou *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns\nand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.\n\nThe major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for\nmore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.\nFor what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop\na new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.

OldPos 6 | 20 b'From: jgreen@trumpet.calpoly.edu (James Thomas Green)\nSubject: Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts.\nOrganization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo\nLines: 51\n\nWhy do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.
