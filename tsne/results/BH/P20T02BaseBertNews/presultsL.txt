In practice, they are not."\n>"You mean you want the revised revision of the original revised revision\n> revised?!?!"\n\n\nAll right.  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I\'ll give \nyour question a shot. \n\nThe key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really \nhave to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need \n10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your \npages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not \ntoner.  But that should go without saying.\n\nMy PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little \nwhile to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once \nthe computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out \nevery 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  \n\nThe BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I\'m assuming that the DeskJet can, or \nHP wouldn\'t sell many......\n\nSize is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built \nlike a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.\n\nFinally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200\'s resolution.  It looks like \na good laser quality print.  The HP\'s I\'ve used.....they look like ink.  Not \nas impressive.  \n\nSo, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?\n'

If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.\n\nMake sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the\nend.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2\nboxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be\ndisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the "experts".\n\nMy experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they\nmust have some software package for the Mac to \'talk\' to them.  My PLI MO\ndrive and Sharp scanner has one for each.\n\nGood luck.\n\nArt Beattie\n==============================================================\nI only speak for myself.\n==============================================================\n'

At the very top and very bottom of the screen\nthere is about a 3/4" bar of black.  The screen isn\'t cut off, it just squeezes\neverything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can\nmanually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just\nshouldn\'t happen anyway.  I\'ve called Gateway numerous times and they haven\'t \nbeen able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and\nboth times the new card didn\'t work at all in my computer.  They even tried\nto bill me for the first card because they didn\'t get it back in a couple of\ndays, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks\nbefore billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...\nSo, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what\nto do.

It is an S3\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn\'t just say "Buy the memory\nfrom us" or something like that.)\n\n\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn\'t have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was "Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid\'s software developers are busy with other projects."\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I\'d love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it\'s not so easy to exchange these things unless they\'re\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are "less\nbusy".  If the magazines are to believed, I\'ve only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\n\nThanks.\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu\n'

However, it\'s still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It\'s probably the\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\n\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\nhere\'s what he told me:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is what is included:\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for\n          analog output.\n        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).\n        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\n        - Rechargable battery.\n\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don\'t mind if I keep the 60 minute\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\n\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he\'s including an\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        I\'m not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\n\n        Again, I\'ve used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I\'ve been using one for a little\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine\nthat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher\nConspiracy for their recent live album.)\n\n        Bryan Davis says:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels\nin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported\nproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        \'nuff said.\n\n        The reason I\'m not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don\'t have any\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn\'t.  (I am also paying more\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\n\n        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,\nby the way.)\n\n        Anyway, if you\'re interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.\n\n-- \nJohn Davison\ndavisonj@ecn.purdue.edu\n'

It has an access of 200ms and a data\ntransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is\navailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two\nmail in coupons for two free CDs.  I\'m not sure if the cd\'s are good, since\nI\'ve only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd\'s shipped\nto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The\nCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,\nwhich supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to\nattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the\nCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly\nlower price with two free CDs.\n\nThe Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I\nthink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the\nthree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple\ncatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo\ncd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of\nwhich are pretty good.\n\nThe NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and\na data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around\n$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn\'t multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible\nbefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of\nthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd\'s\nunless you buy it in a bundle.\n\nOf the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the\nApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it\'s\ncompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it\'s\nspeed and performance. \n\nBTW, the models of the drives are:\n\nApple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)\n\nCD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I\'m not sure, but it\nis also something like with 3401)\n\nNEC:  CDR-74\n\n\nI\'m very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems\nwhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am\npretty sure of myself, even when I think I\'m not.\n\nAlso, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as\nthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,\nmy hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is\njust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the\nenormous chinese community.

I have heard \ncomplaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control \nproblems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.\n\nThere was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not \nmatch up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the \nfrequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that \nthe NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter \nand the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable \npincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness \nwhen I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the \ncontrols.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the \nraster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome \nas the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.\n\nI have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold \nthrough OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that \nway at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has \nmy vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if \nit's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to \nbuy.\n\nI have no experience with the Nanao.

I am very pleased with \nthe results.  The catalog description is as follows:\n\n\tThe Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager \n\tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a\n\tprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two\n\tcounter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits --\n\treleasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.\n\n\tPressure Point Massager    A2623   $109\n\nTo order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or\nfax at 1-800-345-4021.\n\n********\nNOTE:\nWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price\nwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog\nenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  \nQUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,\nand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it\nlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the\nfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a\nreason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to\nship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could \nuse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old \none.  VERY reasonable people.\n********\n\nI have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I \nwould be described as "structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches \nand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  \nIf, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough\ntime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, \nmore prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require \nphysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit \nto get the prescription for p.t.  \n\nThe tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache\n(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my \nphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles \nin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the \nheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to \nwhile it is being massaged.\n\nI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing\nsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my \nneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in \nthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient \np.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up \nin the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.\n\nI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base\nunit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on each\nside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal "thumbs" are about \n1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base.  The thumbs \nare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more \ntoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in \neither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side \nof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either\nside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck\nor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.\n\n\n                 _______________________________\n                |  __    _______________    __  |\n                | |  |  |\t\t|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |\n                | |  |  |\t\t|  |  | |\n                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |\n                | |__|\t\t\t   |__| |\n                |_______________________________|\n\n\nFor the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if \nlaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or \nneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or\nstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are\nalso impaired (I\'m typing this over an extended period of time), and I \ndon\'t have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works \nwell for me.\n\nFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager\nbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or\nnot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  \nIf I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches \nwhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use \nthan the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \n(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and \nmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than \nnothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are \nnot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don\'t \npin it up first.  As far as I\'m concerned, the easier something like this \nis to use, the more likely I\'ll use/do it.  If there are multiple \nconsiderations/hassles, I\'m more likely to not bother with it.\n\nNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion \nfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my\nneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard\nagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a\nfew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  \nAfter that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, \nthe pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  \nI also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the \nmost vulnerable point for me.\n\nIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,\nalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at\na time) to really work it out.\n\nI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I\ncannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I\'ve had\nit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also \nto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have\nbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this \nwas very timely  for me.\n\nThis is the 1st product I\'ve ordered from this company and only recently\nbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been\nin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,\nwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog\nproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought\nput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones\nI\'ve seen such as "Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog" or "Mature Wisdom".\nI\'m only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no\nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, \nparticularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.\n\nI apologize for the length of this, but it\'s the kind of info _I_ would \nlike to know before ordering something thru the mail.\n\n\nRobin Coutellier                   \nNorthern Telecom, Mountain View, CA\nINTERNET: robin@ntmtv.com\nUUCP:portal!ntmtv!robin\n\n\n\n'

I've seen Gravis\njoysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my\nhand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than\na year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability\nto adjust the tension of the stick.\n\nI recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and\nno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. \nI'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\ndown in features.\n\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\n\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\na Gravis gamepad.

Windows will use a swap file\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\nthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book\nthey handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended\nswapfile".  I\'ll quote the information\n\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\n  of RAM on your machine.\n\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\ntelling you what little he knew.\n\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren\'t actually\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\nyou HUGE discounts on software.

The stealth card is not a very good\ndos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non local\nbus).

Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.\n\nP.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie:\ngames) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently\nscores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip\n(ie: stealth and actix cards.)

I\'d rather have the extra round.\n\n> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\nQuite true.

The 80 series Colt\'s for\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\n\n> - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n>   operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nAgreed.\n\nNow that I\'ve shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn\'t cost you much.  On\nthe other hand, I\'ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\nyears.  For example, I\'ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\n\nI\'ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\n\nMost revolvers are more \'fragile\' then semi auto\'s.  There are all sorts\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\'re out of the fight.\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\ninto that category.\n\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\'s "The Semi\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense."\n\nIn general, I\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\n\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\nisn\'t going to train them, they aren\'t going to take the time on their\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\'t bother.\n\nFor myself, I\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\'d rather pick\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\'m wearing that day\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\n\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\ntoo!)\n\nIf this post had gone the other way, I\'d be arguing for revolvers. :-)\n\nRick.\n'

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\nwould call Japan, etc.\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\n\nThanks.\n\nAllan Weber\nSignal & Image Processing Institute\nUniversity of Southern California\nweber@sipi.usc.edu\n"

It is an S3\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn\'t just say "Buy the memory\nfrom us" or something like that.)\n\n\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn\'t have bothered.  I\nasked them why, and all I got was "Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid\'s software developers are busy with other projects."\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I\'d love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it\'s not so easy to exchange these things unless they\'re\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are "less\nbusy".  If the magazines are to believed, I\'ve only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\n\nThanks.\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu\n'

I've been using the standard Windows VGA driver\nwith other similarly configured computers.\n\nI am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.\n\nThe problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start\nchanging themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open\na full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have\nany problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially\nreturn to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.\n\nAlso, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the\ndesign on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but\nthe white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.\n\nThe color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark\npurple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the\nscreen gets refreshed again.\n\nIf I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell\nnetwork, everything is fine.\n\nI originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the\nother machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this\nmachine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine\nand the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried\nreloading Windows to no avail.\n\nAny thoughts on things to check out?

The optoisolator is a 4N35.\nOn the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor\nto the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie my\ncpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor\nof 47k.\n\nIt functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulses\nthat occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't the\nrise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I should\nbe able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz.\nThis is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu\nand to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not\ndoing anything high-speed.\n\nIn the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of the\nphototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the\nspeed.  Is that what I need to do?  How do I calculate the\nresistor value?\n\n\n-- \n\nPaul Malenfant\npmalenfa @ kitkat.webo.dg.com (508-870-6460)\n"

Asante EN/SC\nadapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the\nnewest drivers from Asante\'s ftp server.\n\nThe problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -\nspecifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the "happy Mac face" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn\'t look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn\'t get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I\'ve had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID\'s of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?\nThanks a lot.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.

The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.

Several\npeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated \nexactly what I am looking for.\n\tI'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host\nvia RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require\nabout 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots\nof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be\ninterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it \nwould be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use\nan 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then \ntransfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM\nneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes\nto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).\nEverything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for\nthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART\nbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a \ncompany that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain \ncircuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.\n\nRich\n\n"

When I\noriginally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This\nwas fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.\n\nLately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is\npowered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given\nthe "no disk to boot from" icon.  However, upon turing the\ncomputer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  \nFurthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot \nbutton the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power\noff and on always works.\n\nThis problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before\nit often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.\n\nDoes anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how\nit can be fixed?\n\nI\'m wondering if it\'s getting old and requires more time to \n"come up to speed" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that\nallows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before \ntrying to access the HD?\n\nThanks!\n\n\nAltan J.

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\'ll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\'d bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn\'t give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\'d\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission.

D1).  I thought I\'d post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, "What\'s New" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\'s clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mind\nchildren" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America\'s Space Age won\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\'s science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\'s\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\nits competitiveness agenda.\n\n......\n\n"I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen\nnow," says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  "We\'ve put off a lot of things we shouldn\'t\nhave.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a\n$40-billion one filled with white elephants."\n'

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in\nhassles.\n\nThe important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to\nthe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically\ndown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any\nnew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --\nthe actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,\nyou *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns\nand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.\n\nThe major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for\nmore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.\nFor what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop\na new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper\nmight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less\nambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing\nsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting\nmoney in a big way.\n\nGiven this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a\nminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which\ndominates the cost of the project.\n-- \nAll work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]\n\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\'s idea -- Any Takers?\n'

I am as concerned about the media\'s complicity in this\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\nbehind it.  What\'s going on here?\n\nLet\'s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\nI\'m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\nbecause I\'ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\'s behavior was\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\'s religious\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\n\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\nobstensibly to perform "gas insertions" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\nhim over the edge.\n\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\'s attorney mentioned on TV\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\'s major concern was the biblical\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\n"gas insertion" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\n\nLet\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\n\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\nshow the world how big her balls are.\n\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

It\'s more likely that the Moon will never\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\nmaterials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \nand it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat \nsink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\'s a very minor \nactivity in the global scope of things.\n\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\n\nWe don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\ncenturies, if not much longer.\n\nLuna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again. There\'s little glory in watching from a\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little\nultimate profit either.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n'

I am equally confident that\nthese same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social\nresponsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally\nand ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the\nhundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands\nsolely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To\ndo less than this would place these same groups/individuals in\nthe ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and\npolitically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and\nsubsequent development and urbanization of these former private\nhunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any\nbenefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.\n\nW.

The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

I've seen Gravis\njoysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my\nhand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than\na year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability\nto adjust the tension of the stick.\n\nI recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and\nno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. \nI'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\ndown in features.\n\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\n\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\na Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know\nmuch beyond that.\n-- \n     Will Christie       |    AATCHOO!      | PHILOSOPHY: the principles and \n University of Manitoba  |    Uh-oh...      |  science of thought and reality\n  Winnipeg, MB, Canada   |   I'm leaking    | PHILOSOPHER: someone who thinks\nchrstie@ccu.UManitoba.CA | brain lubricant. |  they're useful to society\n"

I have heard \ncomplaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control \nproblems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.\n\nThere was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not \nmatch up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the \nfrequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that \nthe NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter \nand the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable \npincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness \nwhen I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the \ncontrols.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the \nraster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome \nas the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.\n\nI have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold \nthrough OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that \nway at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has \nmy vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if \nit's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to \nbuy.\n\nI have no experience with the Nanao.

The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes\nthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and\nhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.\n\nDid you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?\n\nIf you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of\nthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  \nAs you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more \nthan you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in \nthe tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is \nat the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best\nguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second\nmarker?  \n\nAnyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape\nis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The\ntape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where\nthe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the \nlight that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty\nor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have\na problem detecting the end of the tape.\n\nIf the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either\nthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open\nthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head\nassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may\nneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor\nis out. \n\nIf it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for\nrepair.\n\n\n---\nScott Hiles\nwhiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil\n\nStandard disclaimer:\n  The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily \n  reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.\n\nMake sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the\nend.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and\nothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations\ncannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be\ndisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2\nboxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be\ndisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the "experts".\n\nMy experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they\nmust have some software package for the Mac to \'talk\' to them.  My PLI MO\ndrive and Sharp scanner has one for each.\n\nGood luck.\n\nArt Beattie\n==============================================================\nI only speak for myself.\n==============================================================\n'

System 7.1 should not have that problem, for most people the \nsolution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor.  In my\ncase MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my\nQuadra\n700, all that occured early last year.\n\nMichael S.

It\'s not fully\nup to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different\nmanufacturer\'s synonyms):\n\n------\nIn practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view\nof the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my\nviews on things like availability and backward compatibility):\n\n74\tThe original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively\n\tobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball\n\tfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.\n\n74H\tModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher\n\tpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74L\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\n\tVery obsolete; use CMOS.\n\n74S\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\n\tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74LS\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\n\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\n\tdevices.\n\n74F\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\n\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\n\n74AS\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\n\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\n\n74ALS\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\n\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\n\n74C\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\n\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\n\tCMOS 74 families.\n\n4000\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\n\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\n\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\n\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\n\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\n\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\n\tclear choice when speed is not important.\n\n74HC\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\n\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\n\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\n\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\n\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\n\tconsumption at faster speeds.\n\n74HCT\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\n\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\n\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\n\n10K\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\n\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\n\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\n\tthe rules or it won\'t work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\n\tcan be expensive.\n\n100K\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\n\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\n\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\n\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\ninteresting but I haven\'t used either significantly yet.\n-- \nAll work is one man\'s work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n'

However, it\'s still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It\'s probably the\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\n\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\nhere\'s what he told me:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is what is included:\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for\n          analog output.\n        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).\n        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\n        - Rechargable battery.\n\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don\'t mind if I keep the 60 minute\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\n\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he\'s including an\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        I\'m not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\n\n        Again, I\'ve used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I\'ve been using one for a little\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine\nthat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher\nConspiracy for their recent live album.)\n\n        Bryan Davis says:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels\nin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported\nproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        \'nuff said.\n\n        The reason I\'m not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don\'t have any\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn\'t.  (I am also paying more\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\n\n        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,\nby the way.)\n\n        Anyway, if you\'re interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.\n\n-- \nJohn Davison\ndavisonj@ecn.purdue.edu\n'

Well,\nthink again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\n\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple\'s attention a problem with\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice "stick" in\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\nBCGA65431. You\'ll recognize this "sticky button" symptom immediately if you\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it\'s not subtle.\n\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \nsuggested that people contact Apple\'s Customer Assistance Center directly\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\nit worth Apple\'s while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don\'t assume you\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\n\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\n\nIf the number isn\'t toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\nthe details of your case, including your mouse\'s serial number.  Be firm.\n\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don\'t send mail to\nme or post yet another "sticky-button" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\nto stone-wall on this issue, don\'t expect them to offer support when the\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.\n\n-- Bill Sloan\n'

If\n\tyou\'re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don\'t\n\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\n\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\n\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\n\n\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\n\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\n\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\n\twith the electrical code, but we don\'t quote sections\n\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we\'re wrong,\n\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\n\n\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\n\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\n\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\n\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\n\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\n\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\n\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\n\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\n\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\n\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\n\trules.\n\n\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\n\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\n\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\n\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\n\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\n\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we\'ve\n\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC\'\' or\n\t``CEC\'\'.\n\n\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\n\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\n\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\n\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\n\tIt\'s revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\n\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\n\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There\'s the\n\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There\'s an abridged\n\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\n\tAnd there\'s the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\n\tcommentary\'\' on the code, as well as the full text.  That\'s the\n\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there\'s no handbook for\n\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\n\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\n\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\n\n\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\n\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\n\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\n\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\n\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\n\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\n\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\n\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\n\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, "CEC" really means the\n\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\n\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\n\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\n\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\n\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\n\n\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\n\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\n\tOntario, it\'s Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn\'t\n\toverly fat.  It\'s about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\n\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\n\tequivalent NEC publications.\n\n\tDon\'t bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\n\tthe province.\n\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\n\n\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\n\tIn some, they\'re not.  Check with your local electrical\n\tinspector.  Most places won\'t permit you to do wiring on other\'s\n\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\n\twiring in "commercial" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\n\tare usually considered "semi-commercial" or "commercial".  However,\n\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\n\twiring if you\'re supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\n\tfind one willing to supervise.\n\n\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\n\n\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\n\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it\'s your own home,\n\tand it\'s you or your family that might get killed if you make\n\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\n\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\n\tIn this FAQ we\'ve consciously given a few recommendations that\n\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it\'s reasonable,\n\tand will impress the inspector.\n\n\tThe inspector will know that you\'re an amateur.  You have to\n\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\n\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don\'t cut corners.\n\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\n\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\n\n\tDon\'t try to hide anything from the inspector.\n\n\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don\'t use a bread knife to strip\n\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\n\twon\'t like it, and the results won\'t be that safe.  And it\n\ttakes longer.  And you\'re more likely to stick a hunk of\n\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\n\n\tDon\'t handle house wire when it\'s very cold (eg: below -10C\n\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\n\tbecome very brittle.\n\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\n\n\tFirst, there\'s the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\n\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you\'re \n\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\n\tdevices) you need Robertson ("square recess") screwdrivers\n\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\n\n\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4" or 1" spade bit and 1/4" or\n\t3/8" electric drill will do.  If you\'re doing a lot, or\n\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2" drill\n\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\n\t3/4" or 1" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\n\tyou through, so they\'re much faster and less fatiguing, even\n\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\n\n\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\n\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\n\twork well).\n\t\n\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\n\tordinary wire cutters.  Don\'t buy the $3 K-mart "combo stripper,\n\tcrimper and bottle opener" types.  You should expect to pay\n\t$15 to $20 for a good "plier-type" pair.  It will have sized\n\tstripping holes, and won\'t nick or grab the wire - it should\n\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\n\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\n\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren\'t\n\tnecessary, and pros usually don\'t use them.\n\n\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\n\tin constricted places.  Don\'t use these for stripping wire.\n\n\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\n\n\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\n\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it\'s better to form wire\n\tloops with a "loop former hole" on your wire stripper - more\n\taccurate.\n\n\tIf you\'re using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\n\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\n\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\n\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\n\t"zipper", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn\'t try to strip\n\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it\'s too easy to\n\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\n\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\n\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\n\tthat you\'ll gouge the conductors.\n\n\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it\'s well\n\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\n\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\n\tor the insulation.\n\n\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\n\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\n\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\n\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\n\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\n\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\n\n\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\n\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\n\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a "audible alarm" type is\n\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I\'ve been known\n\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\n\n\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\n\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\n\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\n\n\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\n\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\n\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \n\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\n\tscrews - I don\'t do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\n\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\n\tthat has no cover plate).\n\nSubject: What is UL listing?\n\n\tThe UL stands for "Underwriters Laboratory".  It used to be\n\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\n\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\n\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\n\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\n\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn\'t necessarily\n\tmean that the device actually does what it\'s supposed to, just\n\tthat it probably won\'t kill you.\n\n\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\n\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\n\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\n\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\n\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\n\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\n\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\n\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\n\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\n\toccupancy permits issued.\n\t\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\n\n\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\n\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\n\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\n\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\n\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\n\trequired by law.\n\n\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\n\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\n\tclaim.\n\n\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\n\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\n\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\n\tcompanies.\n\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\n\n\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\n\n\t    Residential Wiring\n\t    by Jeff Markell,\n\t    Craftsman Books,\n\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\n\n\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\n\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\n\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\n\t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\n\t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\n\n\t    Wiring Simplified\n\t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\n\t    Park Publishing Co.\n\t\n\tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\n\trevision.  Which is currently 1990.\n\n\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\n\t"Electrical Code Simplified".  There appears to be a version\n\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\n\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\n\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY\'ers.  It is better to get\n\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\n\tquestions on the net ;-).\n\n\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\n\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\n\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\n\n\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\n\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\n\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\n\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\n\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\n\tor subsequent owners of your home don\'t get killed or lose\n\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\n\n\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\n\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\n\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\n\tthis.\n\n\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\n\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\n\tclaims.\n\n\tIn general, the process goes like this:\n\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\n\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\n\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\n\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you\'re not\n\t\t  sure of.  If you\'re doing major work, they may impose\n\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\n\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\n\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\n\t\t- If you\'re installing a main panel, you will need to\n\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\n\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\n\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\n\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\n\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\n\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\n\t\t  "rough-in" inspection.\n\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\n\t\t  you will need a "final inspection".\n\nSubject: My house doesn\'t meet some of these rules and regulations.\n\tDo I have to upgrade?\n\n\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\n\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\n\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\n\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major\'\' work, you\n\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\n\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\n\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\n\n\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\n\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\n\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\n\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\n\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\n\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\n\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\n\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it\'s not\n\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\n\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\n\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\n\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\n\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\n\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them "110V" and\n\t"220V", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\n\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\n\n\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\n\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\n\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\n\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\n\tlow.\n\n\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\n\tphases of a 3-phase "Y" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\n\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase "Y"\n\tcircuit that\'s 277V from hot to neutral.\n\n\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\n\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\n\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\n\n\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\n\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\n\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\n\n \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\n \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\n \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\n\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\n\taction conductivity "breaks" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\n\tThis is the "grounding conductor".  It is there to make sure that\n\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\n\tnormally carries no current.\n\n\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\n\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\n\tIt is connected to the "centre tap" (CEC; "center tap" in the\n\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\n\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\n\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\n\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\n\n\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\n\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\n\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\n\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\n\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\n\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\n\n\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\n\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\n\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\n\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \n\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\n\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\n\tinspector.\n\n\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the "hot"\n\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\n\twell.\n\n\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\n\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\n\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\n\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\n\n\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\n\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\n\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\n\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\n\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\n\tservice).\n\nSubject: What is a circuit?\n\n\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\n\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\n\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\n\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\n\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\n\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\n\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\n\n\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\n\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\n\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\n\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\n\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\n\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\n\tair conditioners.\n\n\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\n\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\n\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\n\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\n\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\n\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\n\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\n\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\n\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\n\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\n\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\n\tpermissible.]\n\n\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\n\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\n\n\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\n\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\n\n\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\n\twire.  Since the white is "hot" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\n\trequires that the white wire be "permanently marked" at the ends\n\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\n\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\n\n\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\n\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\n\n\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\n\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\n\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is "frame ground",\n\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\n\talternative to GFCI protection.\n\nSubject: "grounding" versus "grounded" versus "neutral".\n\n\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\n\t"grounding" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\n\tor bare wire.  The word "neutral" is reserved for the white when\n\tyou have a circuit with more than one "hot" wire.  Since the white\n\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\n\tpanel, the proper term is "grounded conductor".  However, the\n\tpotential confusion between "grounded conductor" and "grounding\n\tconductor" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\n\tnever use the bare wire as a "grounded conductor" or white wire\n\tas the "grounding conductor", even though they are connected\n\ttogether in the panel.\n\n\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\n\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\n\n\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word "neutral" is used\n\tfor "grounded conductor".  This FAQ uses "neutral" simply to\n\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use "neutral"\n\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\n\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\n\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\n\n\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\n\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\n\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\n\t"trip", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\n\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\n\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\n\tequipment itself won\'t cause a fire.\n\n\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\n\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\n\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\n\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\n\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\n\ta "time-delay" fuse (one brand is "fusetron") which will avoid\n\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\n\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\n\treplaced.\n\n\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\n\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\n\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\n\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\n\theats up and bends.  By bending it "trips" the latch, and the\n\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\n\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\n\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\n\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\n\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\n\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\n\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\n\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\n\tpurpose.\n\n\tNeither fuses nor breakers "limit" the current per se.  A dead\n\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\n\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\n\tcan often cause severe damage.\n\nSubject: Breakers?  Can\'t I use fuses?\n\n\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\n\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\n\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\n\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\n\tbeing installed, or the proverbial "replace the fuse with a\n\tpenny" trick.\n\n\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\n\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\n\n\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\n\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\n\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\n\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\n\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\n\tBreakers don\'t do this.\n\n\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\n\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\n\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\n\tinserts to "key" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\n\n\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\n\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\n\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\n\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\n\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\n\tif you need one.\n\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\n\n\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\n\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\n\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\n\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\n\t14 gauge, though it\'s stiffer and harder to work with.\n\n\tHere\'s a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\n\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\n\tganged with other wires in a place where they can\'t dissipate\n\theat easily:\n\n\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\n\t\t14\t\t15\n\t\t12\t\t20\n\t\t10\t\t30\n\t\t8\t\t40\n\t\t6\t\t65\n\t\n\tWe don\'t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\n\ton the application and precise wire type.\n\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\n\n\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\n\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\n\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\n\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\n\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\n\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\n\truns.\n\n\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\n\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\n\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\n\tlamps.  Don\'t try this unless you\'re certain that your use fits\n\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\n\twire.\n\nSubject: What does "14-2" mean?\n\n\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\n\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\n\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\n\tremember there\'s usually an extra ground wire.  "14-2" means\n\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\n\n\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\n\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\n\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\n\n\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\n\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\n\nSubject: What is a "wirenut"/"marrette"/"marr connector"?  How are they\n\tused?\n\n\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that\'s used\n\tto connect wires together.  "Marrette" or "Marr connector"\n\tare trade names.  You\'ll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\n\n\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\n\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\n\n\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don\'t need to twist the\n\twire, do it anyways - it\'s more mechanically and electrically\n\tsecure.\n\n\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\n\tthat the wire nut you\'re using is the correct size for the\n\tquantity and sizes of wire you\'re connecting together.\n\n\tDon\'t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\n\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose ("linesman") pliers,\n\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\n\tit\'s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\n\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\n\n\tSome people wrap the "open" end of the wirenut with electrical\n\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\n\ttear it off during an inspection.  It\'s usually done because\n\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\n\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\n\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\n\n\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter\'\'.  It measures\n\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\n\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\n\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\n\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\n\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\n\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\n\tthe circuit.\n\n\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\n\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\n\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\n\twouldn\'t help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\n\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\n\tGFCI happy.\n\n\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\n\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\n\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\n\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\n\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\n\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\n\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\n\n\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\n\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6\' of the sink, garages,\n\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\n\tjust about anywhere else where you\'re likely to encounter water\n\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\n\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space\'\',\n\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\n\tlaundry appliances.\n\n\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\n\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\n\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\n\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they\'re near the door to\n\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\n\n\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\n\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\n\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\n\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\n\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\n\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\n\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\n\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\n\nSubject: Where shouldn\'t I use a GFCI?\n\n\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don\'t pose a\n\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\n\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\n\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\n\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\n\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\n\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\n\tGFCI trips are real; if you\'re getting a lot of trips for no\n\tapparent reason, you\'d be well-advised to check your wiring\n\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\n\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\n\n\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\n\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\n\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\n\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\n\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\n\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\n\tcircuit\'\' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\n\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you\'ll need a\n\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\n\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\n\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\n\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\n\n\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\n\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\n\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You\'ll thank yourself for it.\n\n\tIncidentally, if you\'re installing a GFCI to ensure that one\n\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don\'t\n\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\n\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\n\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\n\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\n\n\tWhen you install a GFCI, it\'s a good idea to use the little\n\t"ground fault protected" stickers that come with it and mark\n\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\n\toutlets are "downstream", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\n\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\n\nSubject: What\'s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\n\n\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won\'t comment on,\n\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won\'t turn on without\n\ta good ground connection), they\'re intended to guard against\n\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\n\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there\'s an\n\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\n\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\n\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\n\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\n\tyou touch it while you\'re grounded, you\'ll get zapped.  Of\n\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\n\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\n\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\n\n\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\n\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\n\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\n\telectrode in a toaster, and you\'re not grounded, nothing will\n\thappen.  If you\'re slightly grounded, you\'ll get a small shock;\n\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\n\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you\'d be the perfect path to\n\tground...\n\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\n\n\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\n\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\n\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\n\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\n\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\n\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\n\n\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\n\n\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\n\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\n\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\n\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\n\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\n\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\n\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\n\n\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\n\tcircuits\'\' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\n\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\n\tthan 24" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\n\tthan 12" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\n\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\n\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\n\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\n\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6\' of a sink *must* be\n\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\n\n\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\n\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\n\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\n\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\n\t"carrying through" to another outlet, the neutral must be\n\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\n\tconnection fall off doesn\'t cause the neutral to disconnect\n\tfrom downstream outlets.\n\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\n\n\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\n\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\n\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\n\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\n\n\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\n\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\n\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\n\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\n\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\n\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\n\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\n\n\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or "AC" has a\n\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\n\tfairly resistant to damage.\n\n\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\n\tsheath.\n\t\n\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\n\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\n\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25" (CEC & NEC)\n\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\n\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\n\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\n\n\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\n\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\n\tbut this is technically illegal.]\n\n\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\n\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\n\treferences to "exposed to mechanical damage" in both the NEC\n\tand CEC):\n\n\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\n\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\n\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\n\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\n\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\n\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\n\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\n\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\n\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to "jump" to the appliance.\n\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\n\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\n\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\n\t      means of a 25mm/1" air space, or suitable insulation\n\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\n\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1\' of every box\n\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5\'.\n\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered "supports".\n\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\n\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\n\t      it is permitted where "proper" support is impractical]\n\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\n\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\n\t      to the "workmanship" clause, but this seems more honoured\n\t      in the breach...]\n\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\n\t      similar finish.\n\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\n\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\n\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\n\t      than 1m (39").\n\n\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\n\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\n\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\n\tthe insulation.\n\n\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\n\tsolid wall coverings.\n\n\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\n\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\n\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\n\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\n\twire.\n\n\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\n\n\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\n\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\n\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\n\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\n\twiring section.]\n\n \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\n \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\n \tpurpose.\n\n\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\n\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\n\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\n\tis that if there\'s a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\n\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\n\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\n\t\n \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\n \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\n \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: "AC90" versus "AC".\n\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\n\n\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\n\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\n\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\n\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you\'re doing anything\n\tthat\'s the slightest out of the ordinary.\n\n\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\n\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\n\n\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\n\n\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\n\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\n\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\n\t\n\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\n\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\n\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\n\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\n\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]\n\nSubject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\n\n\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\n\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\n\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\n\tboxes don\'t use metal cable clamps.\n\n\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\n\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\n\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\n\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\n\n\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\n\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\n\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\n\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\n\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\n\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\n\n\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\n\n\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they\'re accessible\n\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\n\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\n\tget nasty.\n\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\n\n\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\n\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\n\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\n\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\n\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\n\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\n\twiring doesn\'t have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\n\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\n\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\n\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\n\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\n\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\n\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\n\n\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\n\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\n\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\n\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\n\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\n\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\n\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\n\tmounted between the joists.\n\n\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\n\t"pot" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\n\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\n\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\n\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a "coffin" (usually\n\t8\'x16"x12" - made by making a pair of joists 12" high, and covering\n\twith plywood) that doesn\'t have any insulation.  (Yes, that\'s 8 *feet*\n\tlong)\n\n\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3"\n\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\n\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\n\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin\'\' might be worthwhile.\n\tPresumably, that\'s up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn\'t\n\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\n\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can\'t get\n\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\n\tin later.]\n\n\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\n\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\n\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\n\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\n\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\n\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\n\tfor the sensor can vary.\n\n\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\n\tfor use in insulation.  The "coffin" appears the only legal approach.\n\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\n\n\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\n\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\n\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\n\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\n\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\n\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\n\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\n\n\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\n\tand have them come and check out the problem.\n\n\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\n\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\n\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\n\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\n\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\n\n\tThree phase power has three "hot" wires, 120 degrees out of\n\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\n\tbecause it is more "efficient", provides a bit more starting torque,\n\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\n\n\tYou\'re most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\n\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\n\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\n\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\n\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\n\n\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\n\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\n\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\n\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\n\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\n\ta "capacitor start" unit, or use a larger motor as a\n\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\n\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\n\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop\'\' has an\n\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\n\n\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\n\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\n\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\n\n\tTheoretically, it doesn\'t make any difference.  However, there\n\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\n\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\n\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\n\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\n\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\n\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\n\n\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\n\tthan 50 feet long.\n\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\n\n\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\n\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\n\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\n\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\n\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\n\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\n\n\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\n\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\n\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a "stall\n\thorsepower" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\n\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\n\tWhat they don\'t mention is that if you kept it in that\n\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\n\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it\'s drawing far\n\tmore current than it can continuously.\n\n\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\n\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can\'t find that figure,\n\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\n\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\n\n\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\n\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\n\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\n\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\n\n\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\n\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\n\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\n\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\n\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\n\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\n\t       it\'s continuous to the main house ground point, you can\n\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\n\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\n\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\n\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\n\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\n\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\n\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\n\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\n\t       wouldn\'t be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\n\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\n\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren\'t\n\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\n\t       on BX cable.\n\n\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\n\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\n\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\n\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\n\tShould the test button work?\n\n\tWe\'re sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\n\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there\'s\n\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\n\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\n\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\n\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn\'t require\n\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\n\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\n\tif the test button doesn\'t work, something\'s broken, and potentially\n\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\n\n\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\n\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\n\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\n\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\n\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\n\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\n\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\n\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\n\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\n\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\n\tit, and promised to investigate.)\n\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\n\n\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\n\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\n\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\n\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\n\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\n\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\n\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\n\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\n\twhich means you\'d have to "replug" all your equipment.  Lights\n\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\n\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\n\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\n\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\n\tRPM, while you\'re groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\n\n\tDo install lots of outlets.  It\'s easier to install them in the\n\tbeginning, when you don\'t have to cut into an existing cable.\n\tIt\'s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\n\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\n\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\n\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\n\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\n\twrong.\n\n\tNote that some jurisdictions have a "no horizontal wiring"\n\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\n\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\n\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\n\n\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\n\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\n\tDon\'t overload circuits, and don\'t use extension cords if you\n\tcan help it, unless they\'re rated for high currents.  (A coiled\n\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\n\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won\'t withstand as much\n\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\n\n\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\n\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\n\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\n\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\n\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe\'\'\n\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\n\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\n\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\n\t``horsepower-rated\'\' switches instead.\n\n\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\n\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\n\teven if you ``know\'\' that you\'d never use one of your shop\n\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\n\thave a different idea.\n\n\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\n\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\n\nSubject: Underground Wiring\n\n\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\n\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\n\ttubing and possibly lumber (don\'t use creosoted lumber, it rots\n\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\n\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\n\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\n\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\n\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\n\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\n\tof course, don\'t forget the GFCIs.\n\n\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\n\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\n\tyour specific situation.\n\n\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says "buried power\n\tline" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\n\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\n\n\tDuring the 1970\'s, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\n\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\n\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\n\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\n\tWe recommend, even if you\'re allowed to, that do not use it for new\n\twiring.\n\n\tBut don\'t panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\n\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\n\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\n\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\n\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\n\n\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\n\t"cold creep".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\n\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\n\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\n\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\n\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\n\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\n\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\n\tmelt the insulation or fixture it\'s attached to, and possibly even\n\tcause a fire.\n\n\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\n\tinto a house built during the 70\'s, we will cover basic points of\n\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you\'re considering purchasing\n\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\n\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\n\tfor the following things:\n\n\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\n\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\n\t       be stamped with "Al/Cu" or "CO/ALR".  The latter supersedes\n\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\n\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\n\n\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\n\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\n\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\n\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\n\t       up each connection.\n\n\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\n\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\n\n\t    3) "push-in" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\n\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\n\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\n\n\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\n\t       melted insulation, or "baked" fixtures.  Any such damage should\n\t       be repaired.\n\t    \n\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\n\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\n\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\n\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\n\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\n\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\n\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\n\t       you can rent the tool.\n\n\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\n\t       by means of a short copper "pigtail".  See (5) above.\n\t    \n\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\n\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\n    \n\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\n\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\n\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\n\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\n\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\n\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\n\tYou can do this yourself too.\n\nSubject: I\'m buying a house!  What should I do?\n\n\tCongratulations.  But...  It\'s generally a good idea to hire\n\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\n\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\n\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\n\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\n\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\n\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\n\n\tHere\'s some hints on what to look for:\n\n\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\n\n\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\n\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\n\t\t  proper marking.\n\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\n\t\t  a GFCI)\n\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\n\t\t- Switched neutrals\n\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\n\n\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\n\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\n\n\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\n\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\n\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\n\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\n\t\t  it\'s *really* convenient ;-)\n\t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\n\t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\n\t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\n\t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\n\t\t  ceiling\n\t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\n\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\n\t\n\tIn the years since Edison "invented" electricity, several different\n\twiring "styles" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\n\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \n\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\n\n\tThe oldest wiring system you\'re likely to encounter is called\n\t"knob and tube" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\n\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\n\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\n\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\n\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\n\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\n\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\n\tdown the centre of each room, with "taps" off to each fixture.\n\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\n\tcases K&T isn\'t colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\n\tcolour as the hot wires.\n\n\tYou\'ll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40\'s.\n\n\tComments on K&T:\n\n\t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\n\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\n\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\n\t\t  very well.  Most K&T I\'ve seen, for example, is in\n\t\t  quite good condition.\n\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\n\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\n\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\n\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\n\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn\'t balanced very well between\n\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\n\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\n\t\t  any circuit.\n\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\n\t\t  that contain K&T.\n\t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\n\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\n\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\n\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\n\t\n\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn\'t\n\tnecessary to replace it simply because it\'s K&T.  What you should\n\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\n\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it\'s perfectly\n\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\n\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\n\t\n\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\n\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\n\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\n\tused in the 40\'s and 50\'s.  Again, no grounding conductor.\n\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\n\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We\'ve seen whole\n\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\n\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\n\n\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\n\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\n\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\n\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\n\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\n\ttubing.\n\n\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\n\tIt\'s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\n\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn\'t present a hazard\n\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\n\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the "modern" stuff -\n\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don\'t abuse it too much.\n\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\n\n\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\n\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\n\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\n\tincluding the "odd" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\n\tknow what you\'re talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable\n\tsales people.  They\'ll give you much valuable information.\n-- \nChris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541\nPsroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca\nFerret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca\n'

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\ncheap.  \n\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\nonly 650 mv.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical\'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal\' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W\' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you\'d stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in\na powerbook and a ci.

OldPos 164 | 18 b'From: f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\nSubject: Disappointed by La Cie\nOrganization: Univ of Miami IR\nLines: 52\n\nApproximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for\n$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\'ve called La Cie again and they\'ve given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\'t see\nthe drive there\'s a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\'ll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\'t mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\na letter to La Cie\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\'t even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat\'s the moral of this story? I\'m not sure. But I do know I won\'t buy any\nother products from La Cie in the future.\n\nBill Krauthammer\nf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\n\nPS Please don\'t email or post about how good your La Cie product and service\nhas been. I\'m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like\nthat. All I\'m saying is that I\'ve had a disappointing experience with them and\nI\'ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.\n\n'

I hope that is ok)\n\nJose\n\nBad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for Apple\nMacintosh PowerBook Duos) \nMacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.\n\nCOPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993\n\nBy Raines Cohen\n\n     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook\nDuos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss\nand other problems.\n\n     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week\nissued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM\nproducts from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.\nOther vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.\n\n     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\nwake from sleep.\n\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may\nnot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses\nnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed\nwhile the Duo sleeps.\n\n     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo\ncards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology\nWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are\ncertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.\n\n     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers\nDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is\ncompatible with the slower chips.\n\n     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that\nsome third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner\nof the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally\nwhen in a Duo Dock.\n\n     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it\noriginally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all\ncustomers free upgrades to cards that fit.\n\n'

It has an access of 200ms and a data\ntransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is\navailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two\nmail in coupons for two free CDs.  I\'m not sure if the cd\'s are good, since\nI\'ve only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd\'s shipped\nto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The\nCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,\nwhich supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to\nattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the\nCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly\nlower price with two free CDs.\n\nThe Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I\nthink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the\nthree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple\ncatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo\ncd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of\nwhich are pretty good.\n\nThe NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and\na data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around\n$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn\'t multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible\nbefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of\nthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd\'s\nunless you buy it in a bundle.\n\nOf the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the\nApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it\'s\ncompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it\'s\nspeed and performance. \n\nBTW, the models of the drives are:\n\nApple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)\n\nCD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I\'m not sure, but it\nis also something like with 3401)\n\nNEC:  CDR-74\n\n\nI\'m very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems\nwhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am\npretty sure of myself, even when I think I\'m not.\n\nAlso, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as\nthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,\nmy hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is\njust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the\nenormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has\nthree Steve Liu\'s as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and\nlives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.\n\nSteve :-)\n-- \nSteve Liu                      |I wish for a better .sig\ndrlovemd@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu    |Suggestions are very welcome!\ndrlovemd@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu    |\n'

Several\npeople responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated \nexactly what I am looking for.\n\tI'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host\nvia RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require\nabout 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots\nof people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be\ninterfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it \nwould be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use\nan 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then \ntransfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM\nneeds to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes\nto/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).\nEverything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for\nthis application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART\nbuilt-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a \ncompany that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain \ncircuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.\n\nRich\n\n"

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\nwould call Japan, etc.\n\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\n\nThanks.\n\nAllan Weber\nSignal & Image Processing Institute\nUniversity of Southern California\nweber@sipi.usc.edu\n"

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I\'d like to\nask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a\nmarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at\nthis point.  Well, my group\'s plan is to market a "full page" monitor\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology\'s PaletteBook\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height. \nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\napplications, color screens aren\'t really a neccessity.  We could\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\n\nNow, please don\'t write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\nvia email and let me know:\n1. If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\n3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea\n\nAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,\nbut who knows!), please send me some.\n\nThanks in advance!!!\n\n-Mike\n'

I have noticed that the waveform \nsynthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large\ncommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another\ntransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred \ntimes.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to\nmake my measurements hard to repeat.

When I look at the spectrum using an\nHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to \n'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the \ninput since it will read accurately down to DC.\n\nAlso, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, \nhow important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected \nto the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused \nby different cable capacitances)?

We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\'ve ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\'ll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\n\n\nDan Snodgrass\nMedia Services\nLewis & Clark College\nPortland\n'

(There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\n\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: "other\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\nZahlah."  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel\'s\nwithdrawel in 1984, "Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\neconomy."\n\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a "major city")?  Why\ndoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities\nin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the\nlist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?\n\n[1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to\nthe present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.  \n\n[2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: a\ncountry study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.\n\n>>In the early 1980\'s Tyre had over 22,000 people.\n>\n>So far I\'ve seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.\n>Let\'s assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards\n>we are talking about a one-horse town.\n\nA one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.\n(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They\nmay even use cars these days. :-) \n\nThe 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says "Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000."  \nMost other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.\n(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same\nsource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,\nso I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don\'t doubt that the\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \n\n>> After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200\'s, I believe.

Sidon, for example?  Can you make\na case for Tyre having been singled out?\n\n>>Well, it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye\n>>"Tyrian purple" in Roman times. \n>\n>This is correct, but they were under Roman domination, and the \n>majority of the created wealth was siphoned off.

From [2]:\nTyre "receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes\nand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a\nlarge series of coins, occasionally in gold ..."\n\nThe descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don\'t seem to fit\nyour characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems\nto have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching\nwhen you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small\nfishing village.\n\n>Who is Josh McDowell.\n\nA Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.\nHe happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,\n_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).\nThe same sentence, in fact.

It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\nprecedent in the Qur\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\n\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of "fasad". This\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals.

However, the charge of "fasad" can encompass a\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\n"crisis". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\nlevelled at people, not books.\n\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\npoint that the fatwa on "fasad" was issued.\n\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\n\nP.S. I\'m not sure about this but I think the charge of "shatim" also\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\nof the "fasad" ruling.\n'

The Shephard's Rod (now \ndefunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.\n\nThe Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the \nSDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they \nwere the remnant spoken about in Revelation.\n\nAbout the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once \nin control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as \nChrist.\n\nKoresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young \nadult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over \nthe youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.\n\nThey were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of \nweapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US \ngovernment or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were \nputting themselves in a self defense position.  \n\nIn my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn'\nt have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.\n\nIf you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the \nlocal SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you \nsome insight into where Koresh got his theology.\n\nTammy\n"

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

D1).  I thought I\'d post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, "What\'s New" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\'s clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mind\nchildren" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America\'s Space Age won\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\'s science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\'s\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\nits competitiveness agenda.\n\n......\n\n"I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen\nnow," says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  "We\'ve put off a lot of things we shouldn\'t\nhave.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a\n$40-billion one filled with white elephants."\n'

We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - "you\'ve lost it!"  The "me" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened\nto your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn\nV\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!\n\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\nAmerican.  Let\'s go fly it!\n'

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]\n\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\'s idea -- Any Takers?\n'
OldPos 33 | 5 b'From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)\nSubject: RIMSAT, US/Russian joint venture\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 121\n\n\nI\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\'ve \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\n\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\nslots.\n\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\nsupporting Tonga\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \nthe Pacific Rim. \n\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\'t think I\'ll visit there for a long time.\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\nthat people operate.  For example "everybody can sell you everything."  \nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\n\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\n\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \nSiberia (can\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\n\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \nspecifications, they\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\nnow.\n\nTidbits:\n\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\nthat "we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier."\n\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\nwithin 9 months.\n\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\n\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\npartly because we aren\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government "every two weeks" but we don\'t worry \nbecause we\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\nreally goes on in Russia we won\'t worry about their stability as much.\n\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the "equivalent" value in \nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\n\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\n\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\nhardware.\n\n-- \nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t    "Find a way or make one."\n\t             -attributed to Hannibal\n'
OldPos 82 | 6 b'From: buenneke@monty.rand.org (Richard Buenneke)\nSubject: DC-X Rollout Report\nX-Added: Forwarded by Space Digest\nOrganization: [via International Space University]\nOriginal-Sender: isu@VACATION.VENARI.CS.CMU.EDU\nDistribution: sci\nLines: 124\n\n\nMcDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X\n\n        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern\nCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last\nSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents\' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe\'re going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t\nsustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let\'s not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\n\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\n\n\n'

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.\n\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\n'

I was referring to the fact\nthat far more aeronautical development took place in the \'30\'s.  For much\nof the \'20\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.

The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),\nOrteig\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in\n1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.

Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

Mckissock)\nSubject: Gibbons Outlines SSF Redesign Guidance\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \nNntp-Posting-Host: tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov\nOrganization: NASA Lewis Research Center / Cleveland, Ohio\nLines: 76\n\nNASA Headquarters distributed the following press\nrelease today (4/6). I\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\n\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\n\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President\'s new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation."\n\nNASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-\nWest Space Science Center at the University of Maryland\nunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\n\n'

However, the rumors\n>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\n>seems more likely.\n\nYo Ken, let\'s keep on-top of things! Both the "External Tank" and\n"Wingless Orbiter" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the "giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles," and building a "station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed."\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday\'s Times).\n\nOption "A" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\'s\n     qualified for STS and ELV\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption "B" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options "A" and "B".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.\n\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\ncylinder that\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\n  - 7 berthing ports\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\n  - increased crew time for utilization\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\n'
OldPos 37 | 14 b'From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)\nSubject: DC-Y trajectory simulation\nKeywords: SSTO, Delta Clipper\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 91\n\n\nI\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\'ve \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\n\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \n"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions" here at the University of\nIllinois. Mr Nelson\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\'t think the details\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\nthey aren\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\n\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\n                  ______\n3 G         /|   /      |\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \n          /  | /        |\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\n       /                |          the graph wasn\'t up for very long.\n1 G   /                 |\n                        |\n                        |\n0 G                     |\n\n             ^          ^\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\n\n\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\nout entirely.\n\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \nthat desired.\n\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\n\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\n    all at once?\n\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\n\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\n\nA:  Can\'t tell us.  "Read Aviation Leak."  He also apparently had a good \n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \n\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\n\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\'s reentry profile about \n60 degrees south latitude.\n\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\'t know about that\naspect of the flight profile.\n\n-- \nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t    "Find a way or make one."\n\t             -attributed to Hannibal\n'
OldPos 3 | 15 b'From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office \nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 71\n\nI have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\'d GIF images contain charts outlining\none of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in\nCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

As far as we know it has no\nmaterials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \nand it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat \nsink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\'s a very minor \nactivity in the global scope of things.\n\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\n\nWe don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\ncenturies, if not much longer.\n\nLuna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again. There\'s little glory in watching from a\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little\nultimate profit either.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n'
OldPos 30 | 18 b"From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)\nSubject: Re: Guns for Space\nKeywords: Sopa Gun, Space Launcer\nOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL\nLines: 72\n\n\nOkay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"

I would call it the granite years,\nreflecting the primitive nature of it.  It was  romantic,\nswashbuckling daredevils,  "those daring young men in their flying\nmachines".  But in reality, it sucked.  Death was a highly likely\noccurence,  and  the environment blew.  Ever see the early navy\npressure suits,  they were modified  diving suits.  You were ready to\nstar in "plan 9 from outer space".   Radios  and Nav AIds were\na joke,  and engines ran on castor oil.  They  picked and called aviators\n"men with iron stomachs",  and it wasn\'t due to vertigo.\n\nOddly enough, now we are in the golden age of flight.  I can hop the\nshuttle to NY for $90 bucks,  now that\'s golden.\n\nMercury gemini, and apollo were romantic,  but let\'s be honest.\nPeeing in bags,  having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime\nyou needed a bowel movement.  Living for days inside a VW Bug.\nRomantic,  but not commercial.   The DC-X  points out a most likely\nnew golden age.  An age where  fat cigar smoking business men in\nloud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls\nand used space ship lots.\n\nhhhmmmmm,  maybe i\'ll  retract that golden age bit.   Maybe it was\nbetter in the old days.  Of course, then we\'ll have  wally schirra\ntelling his great grand children, "In my day,  we walked on the moon.\nEvery day.

The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\nprovided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will\ninclude high-level experts from other European and African\norganisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for\nthe training course are being provided by the United Nations\n\n\n\nTrust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the\nprimary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\n\nA similar training course is being planned for Latin American\nexperts.\n\n\n"

OldPos 915 | 15 b'From: mogal@deadhead.asd.sgi.com (Joshua Mogal)\nSubject: Re: Hollywood Hits, Virtual Reality\nOrganization: Silicon Graphics, Inc.\nLines: 137\nNNTP-Posting-Host: deadhead.asd.sgi.com\n\nSorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\n\nI\'m the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\ncan help a little.\n\nIn article <1993Mar17.185725.13487@relay.nswc.navy.mil>,\nrchui@nswc-wo.nswc.navy.mil (Raymond Chui) writes:\n|> Hello, the real reality. Our agency started to express interest in\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies "The Terminater 2" and "Lawnmover\n|> Man".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\n\n\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\nper second).\n\n\n|> \n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\n|> companies,\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\n\n\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\ndata representations.\n\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\neven SGI\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\n\n\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\n\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.
