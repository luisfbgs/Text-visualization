I have\nused Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource\nconverter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially\nthe naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.\nWith windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance,\nthis doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK,\nand Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So \nyour constructor should know how to convert a #define into the\nproper resource identifier.\nI'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does\nuse resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to\nport to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel\nfor anything ) \n\n\n\nAlex.\n\n\n--\n__  __|       \\      __|       Alex Colburn                  \n   |       /   \\    |          Image Analysis Facility      \n   |      _____ \\   __|\t       University of Iowa          \n______| _/      _\\ _|          colburn@tessa.iaf.uiowa.edu  \n"

The three problems I see are:\n\n  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.\n  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.\n  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the\n     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.\n\nBeing more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these\nlimitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff\nfloating around blithely accept what they\'re given?  I could write\nthe server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, \nbut I\'d rather avoid this if not necessary.\n\nI know there are no absolutes, but I\'d appreciate hearing people\'s\nopinions and suggestions.

Windows will use a swap file\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\nthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book\nthey handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended\nswapfile".  I\'ll quote the information\n\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\n  of RAM on your machine.\n\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\ntelling you what little he knew.\n\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren\'t actually\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\nyou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick\nup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.\nThat is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You\ncould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself\nI sprang for Word.\n\nWell, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone\nwill go to a workshop and save a little money.\n\nAnd if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.\nI need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)\n\nThanks,\nBrent Casavant\nbcasavan@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu\n\n'

This particular product\nuses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent\nPC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation\nprocessed PS.\n\nThe quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for\nthe PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.\n\nWe were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was\naccepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts\nthe image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript\nprocessor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is\nresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our\ncamera images came out very good in my opinion.

The problem was not the resurrection\nwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population \n(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was\nthat Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the\nstate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism \nbecomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,\nand were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,\nand hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since\nChristians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is\nseen by Nero\'s blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let\'s not cloud the\nissues with the resurrection.\n\nrandy\n\n[I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically\nbecause they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did\ncause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus.\nOf course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other\nthan a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians\nscholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event --\nin effect, a delusion.  --clh]\n'

There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the \nFuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There\nused to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in\nTexas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.\nControllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses\nthough.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but\nI think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,\nif you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.\nCheers,\nCorwin\n'

The first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of\nCasablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little\ngrainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it\nhad 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.\n\nI consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many \nother formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don\'t know what\nkind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy\nthat showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.

Whenever I save an icon which contains dark\ncolors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the\nbright colors. This happens with every icon editor including the image\neditor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP files\neither; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is with\nthe icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the file\nwith a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing the\ncolormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I can\nfix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem? \n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n--\nSadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nCenter for Reliable and High-performance Computing\ne-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu\n"

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

1 b'From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office \nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 71\n\nI have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\'d GIF images contain charts outlining\none of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in\nCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I\'ll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as \n      the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun\n'

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"
3 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'
4 b"From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)\nSubject: Re: Guns for Space\nKeywords: Sopa Gun, Space Launcer\nOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL\nLines: 72\n\n\nOkay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"

Both spacecraft will team up with\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\n     Japan\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\nwhile within view on Earth.\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\'s project manager for the\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\n     "One of our main activities is developing the methodology\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\ncelestial objects," said Smith.\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\n     "There is a long history of radio astronomy using\nground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is to\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy."\n     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galactic\nnuclei, you\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\nthan you would expect."\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\nthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look further\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\'s\nparticipation in the project.\n     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians have\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\nscience mission.\n     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"\nhe said.\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\nambitious project, JPL\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\n     "Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\nscientifically exciting missions."\n                           ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.\n\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\n'

April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n\t"Basically what we\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."\n\n\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n\t"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n\t"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"\nHeflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives."\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour\'s June flight and Discovery\'s July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.\n\n- end -\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\'s. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\'s minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development."\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\nprovided by the Agency.

You\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity -\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\nwho consider themselves "christians" are (even those who manage to head\ntheir own "churches").

No one can browbeat you\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\nmodern offshoots like the "new age movement" teach or does he require God\'s\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\nsome people it did comprise their life\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you\'ve never read "A Pilgrim\'s\nProgress," I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\n\n>Peace and Love\n>In God(ess)\'s name\n>James Moss\n\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\nwrote that "I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\nof the teachings of christ".  Well, Christ referred to God as "My Father",\nnot "My Mother", and while the "maleness" of God is not the same as the\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\npopulation.\n\nWell, I\'m not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\narticle.

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\'s actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\nfall...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\n'
17 b"From: bfinnert@chaph.usc.edu (Brian Finnerty)\nSubject: Mary's assumption\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 34\n\nA few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\nearth:\n\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.\n\nBrian Finnerty\n"

McCord)\nSubject: Questions from a newbie\nOrganization: University of Virginia\nLines: 56\n\n\n\tIs life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a\ncurve?\n\tI\'m new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to\nknow what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\nhe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\nAlso, are we "graded" by those around us, or has there always\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person\'s childhood taken\ninto account?\n\tI\'m sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\nmost of you, but I figure that you\'re the experts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-Quinn\n\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\nthat\'s because our primary source of information is prophets and\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\nboth Jesus\' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like "even XXX will be better\noff than you in the judgement."  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\nto the Bible and "Holy Tradition" of a more generic Christian sort.\n\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\nus from the results of a test that we couldn\'t possibly pass.  If you\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it\'s easy to\nsee why you\'d be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\n\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\nhow far God\'s cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don\'t\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\ndescription of how to be saved, but it\'s not clear to me that he\nprovided an exact description of how he\'s going to place the dividing\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can\'t expect to know whether\nother individuals are saved or not.\n\n--clh]\n'

Massive amounts of regolith would\nhave to be processed.\n\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo\'s claims some time ago about the moon\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn\'t\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth\'s crust,\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\n\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; "high-Ti" basalts (Apollo 11\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\nbasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\nmined today).\n\n\tPaul F.

You will see the floppy disk and\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\n\tof the mac.\n \n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\n    need release.\n \n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\n    to release it.\n                                            \n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\n\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\n    here.\n\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\n\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\n\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\n\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\n    slots.\n\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\n\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\n\t\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\n\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\n\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\n\t\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\n\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\n\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\n    into place.\n\t\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\n    DRIVE CABLE.\n\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\n\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\n\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\n\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\n\n"

(alveolus?)\n    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done\n    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen\n    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\n\n  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\n    gas per unit volume. \n\n  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs\nor interfere with their healing or anything like that... \n\n--\nWim Lewis, wiml@u.washington.edu\n"

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail\npackage so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport\npackage on top of that which is utterly stupid but that\'s what they\nrequire to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc\nfor the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another\ndedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail\ngoing but you indicate that that is what you want to do.  \n\nThere is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don\'t know if it\nis MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the\nmail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a\nUnix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail\nis routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.\nMost messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail\non the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.\nWhere ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header\nthen a message saying "Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)".  If you\ncan stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people\nof course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably\nthe problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one\nsupport call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I\nam looking vigorously for a better Idea.  \n\nIf you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please\ndrop me a note - anyone.  The next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ip\nbuilt in THEY say........  The netxt itteration of w4wg\n\nGood Luck!!!!!\n\n*******************************************************************\n  Wes James                   Email:  wesj@extsparc.agsci.usu.edu\n  Utah State University\n  Cooperative Extension\n  Systems Specialist\n  UMC 4900                    Voice:  (801)750-2229\n  Logan, UT 84322-4900          FAX:  (801)750-3268\n*******************************************************************\n\n'

This impressive change in the province\'s ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." \n (See also Map 1.

Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \n scattered bones of the dead." \n\n                             Ohanus Appressian\n                            "Men Are Like That"\n                                   p. 202.\n\n\n SOME OF THE REFERENCES FROM EMINENT AUTHORS IN THE FIELD OF MIDDLE-EASTERN\n HISTORY AND EYEWITNESSES OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE OF 2.5 MILLION MUSLIMS\n\n1.

This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in\n   Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.\n\n   However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their\n   homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political\n   thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the\n   Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.\n\n   As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat\'s mind.\n\n   Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true\n   super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the\n   Jews used to establish their state : Religion.\n\n\n   Ahmed.\n\nForget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that\nthe PLO does not recognize Israel\'s right to exist. This is perfectly\nobvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for\nthe destruction of the "Zionist entity". As far as I know the\nIsrael-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies\nthe purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can\npost the relevant caluses.\n\nNow the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been\nposted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am\nsure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than\nhappy to repost it.\n\nRegardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and\neven the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very\nheart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.\n\nIt just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson\'s suggestion that Jews support\npeople envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing\none to many Jews.\n\nHarry.\n'

There is no planet inside of\nthe orbit of Mercury.\n\nThe idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury\'s observed\nperihelion precession and the value it should have had according to\nNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier\'s system\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\nafoot with Mercury.\n\nBut alas, \'twere not so.  Mercury\'s perihelion precesses at the rate\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\ncurved due to the sun\'s mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\nand Albert Einstein\'s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \ngeometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of\nit\'s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession\nof Mercury\'s perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb\'s\nnumbers rather than Leverrier\'s.)\n\nOf course not everybody believes Einstein, and that\'s fine.  But subsequent\nefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar\nhave been fruitless.\n\n-Bill Gawne\n\n "Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe\n  are the laws of the universe."                       - G.

Also,\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\nperiod? \n\nQuestion #2\n\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \ntrial for the shooting?\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?\n\nPlease send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g\na little faster than I can handle.

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the \'Laker Girls\' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.\n\ndvb\n'

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.\n\n==clip==\n"

The way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from \ncommunication equipment. It seems logical to provide Clipper chip \nto the end-user not as a part of phone, fax, modem & like but in the\nform of smart-card compatible with various telecomm. products. Banks \nwill encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone.\nNatural step will be to cross-reference this card to the person in the \ngovernment databases - or else this new version of "wiretap proposal" \nmake no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular \nperson, not on the particular modem or phone.\n \nAs a side note, I disagree with one poster, who said he won\'t care about\nability of the government to eavesdrop, since they can do that now \nanyway. Clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens, \nmaking it monopoly of the government. May be, we can find examples when\ninterceptions made by (unauthorised) people uncovered crimes of \nstate officials ?\n\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      For PGP2.1 public key finger mkagalen@lynx.dac.northeastern.edu\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'

I had drove it for couples times and I\nthink its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru\ndealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer\ntold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to\ndisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.\nAt first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto\nbut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any\nSVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is\ntrue, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me.

If\nOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an\nextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold\nat third.  Thus Olerud\'s doubles have more advancement value than\nAlomar\'s.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\ndouble.)\n\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.

Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well\nin the 1950\'s for all teams.  \n\nBill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.

There is no evidence that any foods will bring on \n>recurrence of Crohn\'s. \n\nInteresting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  I\'m\ncertainly not questioning Steve\'s claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I\nagree that foods don\'t bring on the recurrence of Crohn\'s.  But inflammation\ncan be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.\n\nHaving had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough\ncaveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,\nthe idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be\nrealized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds\nof inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.\nTherefore, anything that doesn\'t digest completely by the point of common\ninflammation should be avoided.  With what I\'ve been told is typical Crohn\'s,\nof the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:\n\nCompletely out - never again - items:\n\to corn (kernel husk doesn\'t digest ... most of us know this :-)\n\to popcorn (same)\n\to dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins\n\to nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)\n\nDiscouraged greatly:\n\to raw vegetables (too fibrous)\n\to wheat and raw grain breads\n\to exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it\'s apparently mostly water)\n\to greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)\n\to little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby\'s without it!)\n\to long grain and wild rice (husky)\n\to beans (you\'ll generate enough gas alone without them!)\n\to BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing\n\nI was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this\nday and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your\nsystem as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the\nNUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try\nthe ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it\'s bad, don\'t do it again!\nRemember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the\ndaylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it\'s cooks more\nthoroughly - you\'re mileage may vary.\n\nAs with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don\'t just take my word.  But\nthis is the info I\'ve been given, and it may be a starting point for\ndiscussion.  Good luck!\n\n-Spenser\n\n\n-- \nS.

Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)\'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can\'t allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

First, I recommend the Sony\nCPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed\nspecifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video\ncapabilities which means only the LC\'s and anything after the ci.  All it\ntakes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is\nabout $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of\ncomparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half\na year and I love it.  \nSecond, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a\nSupra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons\nwhy there were delays and they had Supra\'s number ready for me.  The only\ncomplaint was that they did not always return my calls.  \nI have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R\'s\n(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don\'t know.\n\n-David\n\n**** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the \nfrequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that \nthe NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter \nand the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable \npincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness \nwhen I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the \ncontrols.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the \nraster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome \nas the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.\n\nI have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold \nthrough OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that \nway at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.

I have noticed that the waveform \nsynthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large\ncommon mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another\ntransient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred \ntimes.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to\nmake my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with \nline frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).\n\nHow can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an\nHP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to \n'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the \ninput since it will read accurately down to DC.\n\nAlso, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, \nhow important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected \nto the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused \nby different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for \nuse with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would\nappreciate it.  \n"

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n'

A columnist for the St. \nPaul "Pioneer Press" wrote an article giving the "inside scoop" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\'t remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota "\nIce Demons?") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\'t \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\'t be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\tSo, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n\t\n\tGo Sabres!\n\t\n\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\n\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu\n'

For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

Both spacecraft will team up with\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\n     Japan\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\nwhile within view on Earth.\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\'s project manager for the\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\n     "One of our main activities is developing the methodology\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\ncelestial objects," said Smith.\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\n     "There is a long history of radio astronomy using\nground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is to\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy."\n     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galactic\nnuclei, you\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\nthan you would expect."\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\nthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look further\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\'s\nparticipation in the project.\n     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians have\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\nscience mission.\n     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"\nhe said.\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\nambitious project, JPL\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\n     "Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\nscientifically exciting missions."\n                           ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'
OldPos 159 | 6 b'From: baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (Ron Baalke)\nSubject: SIRTF Mission is Still Alive\nOrganization: Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nLines: 114\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\nKeywords: SIRTF, JPL\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \n\nFrom the "JPL Universe"\nApril 23, 1993\n\nSIRTF is still very much in business\n\nBy Mark Whalen\n     In these times of extra-tight NASA budgets, the very\nsurvival of a number of missions has been uncertain. But thanks\nto major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL\'s\nSpace Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major project\nconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is "alive\nand well," according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.\n     A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have\nadded up to a less expensive project with "tremendous scientific\npower" and a bright future, said Werner.\n     Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful Infrared\nAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer\n(COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for\ninfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000\nor 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.\n     IRAS\' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10\nyears ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never\nbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25\ncomets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than\nany previously available from ground-based observations. COBE has\nmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large\nangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.\n     But to illuminate SIRTF\'s potential, Jim Evans, JPL\'s\nmanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,\nrecently said that the project is "1,000 to 1 million times more\ncapable than IRAS," based on technological advances in infrared\ndetector arrays.\n     However, despite the enormous strides in infrared\nexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as the\nhighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s\n(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a "diet or die"\ndirective from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project\ngoing, according to Werner.\n     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the key\nfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the sun\ninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocket\nlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. "The\nmain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your\nlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don\'t have to\ncarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit," Werner said.\nThe other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that "it\'s in a\nbetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth."\n     Additional major changes in SIRTF\'s redesign include\nshortening the mission from five to three years and building a\nspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original\nplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)\ncompared to Titan SIRTF\'s 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).\n     All of that adds up to "a less stressful launch\nenvironment," Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200\nmillion for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the\ndesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.\n     Werner said SIRTF\'s redesign came as a result of Congress\'\ntelling NASA "you\'re trying to do too many things. If you want us\nto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to see\nhow it fits into (NASA\'s) overall strategy."\n     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA\'s highest\npriority "flagship" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary\nSpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessing\nfrom the National Academy of Sciences.\n     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping\nto keep the project alive, SIRTF\'s major scientific contribution\nalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector\narrays, which will allow images to be developed "tens of\nthousands of times faster" than before, according to Evans.\n     "Up until a couple of years ago," Werner said, "all infrared\nastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays\nof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Department\nof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or\nhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and\nthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF."\n     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget\npressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an\neye out for any "technological spinoff."\n     "On that question, I think we have some things to say," he\nsaid, "because the detectors we\'re using are straight off various\nmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.\naerospace industry, and it\'s a real technological and engineering\nchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.\n     "SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,"\nWerner added, but the revised three-year mission "puts a premium\non observing time. We have to educate the user community and\ndevelop a program that involves early surveys and quick\nturnaround of the data."\n     Werner said the downsizing of the project required a\nreduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF\'s three instruments --\nthe infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband\nimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result in\nlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.\n     The project hopes to start a "Phase B" activity in 1995,\nwhich will provide a detailed concept for development and design.\nBuilding the hardware would begin about two years later.\n     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950\nmillion.\n     "I am very optimistic about SIRTF," he said. "It will\nprovide a tremendous return for the investment."\n     Werner added that an additional benefit from the project\nwill be the "enrichment of our intellectual and cultural\nenvironment.

The article starts with "A leader\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\nbe impossible." O\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\nmeaningful research "is a real question for me."\nO\'Connor said "everything is fair game," including\n"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\nmanned space shuttle fleet."\n\nO\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\ninto three categories based on cost.\n\nThe Post says O\'Connor described the design derived\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\nlistened in on part of O\'Connor\'s briefing to the press\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\'Connor\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\nCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\'Connor say\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\nthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).\n\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\nas "one features modules that could gradually be fitted\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."\n\nThe last sentence in the article contradicts the title\n& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He\n[O\'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned\nspace station Freedom is still possible within the\nadministration\'s budget guidelines."\n\n'

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\nBooks, Inc.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\nDC  20006.\n\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\n\n  It\'s now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it\'s only a dispute\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it\'s far\nmore than that.\n\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\n\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\n\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty\'s navy cannot\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\nmatter how risky they may be.\n\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\nmy friends, Her Majesty\'s navy has sailed into a trap.\n\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we\'ve been hearing\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\n"armada" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\n\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\nreign of England\'s Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake\'s\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\n\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\n\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain\'s\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\nNavy.\n\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\n\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\n\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\nthem.\n\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\n\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO\'s\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it\'s\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\n\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What\'s this\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\nmajor media is "oil."  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\n\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\n\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\nnot Britain.\n\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina\'s\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina\'s\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\nIsland at all?\n\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\nenormous military secret.  It\'s a giant underground installation\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\nI will describe shortly.\n\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\nWashington.  For the past two months I\'ve been reporting the\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\nand verify them.\n\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\n\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia\'s new rulers in the Kremlin are\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\nthe "PROJECT Z" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\nthe world.\n\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\nand Russia\'s new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\n\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\nBrothers.\n\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\n\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\nHemisphere war.\n\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\nbut very little of the air changes places.\n\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called "Coordinator of\nHemispheric Defense" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\nnatural resources.\n\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\nNo. 36.\n\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\nRockefellers.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\ninherit the Earth.\n\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\n\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\n\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\n\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand\'s extreme\nimportance in the coming war.\n\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\ndown virtually to the water\'s edge.  The other part of the\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\n\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\nPacific.\n\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\n\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960\'s. \nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\nappearance both during and after construction.\n\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\n\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60\'s McNamara\npresided over the public paring back of America\'s visible\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\n\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\ntechniques.\n\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\npowered--nuclear "subs"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\n\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\n\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called "Stealth Program" has\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\n\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\ngenerates the field.\n\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\nStates Military.  Now it\'s the American Bolsheviks who are in\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\n\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\nbeing called the "Falklands crisis."\n\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\n"PROJECT Z", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\nWAR ONE.\n\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\nWashington.  It\'s a plan by which the United States will strike\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\nwith Russia.\n\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\n\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\nfast running out.\n\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\ncertain ways.\n\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\nand is responsible for the so-called "Falkland crisis" now\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\n\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\n\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\n\n   The exact details of the "PROJECT Z" war plan are not known to\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\nare known to be as I described last month.\n\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\n\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\n\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\n\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\nalso its Achilles\' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\n\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\ndo.\n\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\n\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship "Endurance" put 22\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\nthe Argentine flag.\n\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\n\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  "Nothing new",\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina\'s point of\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\n\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\nwould be a nerve gas.\n\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\ncontrolled.  That\'s why Margaret Thatcher always says, "Me, too"\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\n\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\ndoors would be suicide.\n\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\npreparations.\n\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on "Red\nAlert."  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\nsea undergoing "sea trials", but that still left seven (7) major\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\n\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina\'s Foreign Minister,\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\ncertain officials.  He got them!\n\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\nofficial stories about "slow movement" of the British armada were\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\n\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\nshambles of the plan.\n\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian "sub" closed in and quickly\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\nknown, there were no survivors.\n\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\nresults, both important:\n\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\n\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\nNew Zealand!\n\n   The British ship\'s sinking of April 14 was also followed by\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, "Time is running out." \nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\n\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\nstill out of range.\n\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\n\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\ntactics which the Russians employed.\n\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The "subs" were armed\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\naround the world.\n\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\n\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called "nuclear freeze\nmovement."  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\nthere were a nuclear war.\n\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\nmoney--and plenty of it.\n\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\nmachine at work.  As I\'ve explained in the past, the Rockefeller\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\n\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\nand Russia; but as Russia\'s new rulers know very well, this does\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\nRockefeller group.  It\'s purely a matter of practical necessity\nright now for the Rockefellers.\n\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\n\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it\'s scaring people. \nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\n\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\nname, though this may be changed, is the "World Nonproliferation\nCouncil."  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\n\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\n\n   Now it\'s time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain\'s Waterloo at sea\nmay well be at hand.\n\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\ntells us, our Lord "...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind."  We must learn to wage\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, "Blessed are the\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God."\n\n   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,\nand may God bless each and every one of you.\x1a\n'
OldPos 548 | 10 b'From: vek@allegra.att.com (Van Kelly)\nSubject: Re: Prayer in Jesus\' Name\nOrganization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA\nLines: 39\n\nAccording to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking "in X\'s\nname" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today\nwould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus\' culture authorized\nto conduct business "in John\'s name" had full authority over John\'s\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\nwork only for John\'s benefit and consonant with John\'s wishes.  It was\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\n"in John\'s name"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\nand religious definitions of "faith".)\n\nWith this cultural background, praying "in Jesus\' name" does not\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\n"fiduciary" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\nKingdom.  The message of "praying in Jesus\' name" is thus closely\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\'s\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying "in Jesus\' name" is not only\npresent but prominent in the Lord\'s Prayer, although the verbal\nforumula is absent.\n\nThe act of praying the words "In Jesus\' Name" may be beneficial if\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\nadvancement of God\'s Kingdom.  For that reason, I\'m not quite ready\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\n\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\netc.) don\'t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that\'s B.C.E. or\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don\'t see anything in Christ\'s words to\ncontradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His\nomniscience and grace.\n\nVan Kelly\nvek@research.att.com\n\n\nThe above opinions are my own, and not those of AT&T.\n'
OldPos 2366 | 11 b'From: clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement)\nSubject: White House Public Encryption Management Fact Sheet\nOrganization: National Institute of Standards & Technology\nDistribution: na\nLines: 94\n\n\n\nNote:     The following was released by the White House today in\n          conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip\n          encryption technology.\n\n                           FACT SHEET\n\n                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT\n\nThe President has approved a directive on "Public Encryption\nManagement."  The directive provides for the following:\n\nAdvanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption\nare part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. \nEncryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of\ncommunications and data by preventing unauthorized access. \nAdvanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to\nrapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. \nThese advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the\ninfrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the\ninformation age.\n\nDespite its benefits, new communications technology can also\nfrustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\ninnovative approaches.\n\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\n\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\n\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\nescrow system.\n\nKEY-ESCROW\n\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\ncommunications.\n\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\na final standard within six months of this directive. \n\nThe Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\nthe extent needed to preserve the government\'s ability to conduct\nlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\nlaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\nshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\nSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\n'

(random access memory boards for Apple\nMacintosh PowerBook Duos) \nMacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.\n\nCOPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993\n\nBy Raines Cohen\n\n     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook\nDuos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss\nand other problems.\n\n     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week\nissued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM\nproducts from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.\nOther vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.\n\n     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called\nselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But\nTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with\nnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to\nwake from sleep.\n\n     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part\nnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips\ninstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may\nnot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses\nnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed\nwhile the Duo sleeps.\n\n     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo\ncards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology\nWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are\ncertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.\n\n     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers\nDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is\ncompatible with the slower chips.\n\n     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that\nsome third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner\nof the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally\nwhen in a Duo Dock.\n\n     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it\noriginally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all\ncustomers free upgrades to cards that fit.\n\n'

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

[Honestly.]\nThe word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]\n\n\nDoes one man\'s words encompass the majestic vision of thousands\nof individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the\nOrder.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much\ndifferently than had one applied them within the confines of\ntheir original expression.\n\nI think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior \nof the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit\nfrom Merlinus X\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss\' background, but surely\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \nfor many years.\n\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\n\n\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\n\n"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \nKellner\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\nin Reuss\'s Masonic publication, \'Oriflamme\'.  On Kellner\'s death,\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \'Jubilee\' edition of\nthe \'Oriflamme\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\nsecret of sexual magic.\n \n"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\n\n"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\' leadership.\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\n\n"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\'s request, deeply\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation."\n\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\'\n\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\n\n\n\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\nfor very many interpretations.\n\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\nsupport of the \'Law of Thelema\' is laughable at best.\n\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \nWill I?  \nI think not.\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\n\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\nI do not support Reuss\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\nthe Order has \'gone soft\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\n\n\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\nof the organization as it stands.\n\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \nI followed my intuition, and I\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\'m happily participating\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\nMass well enough for my tastes.\n \n\nThis doesn\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\nlimited contact with other members.\n\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\nand the preservation of individual vision.\n\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\nto other posts in this thread.\n\n\nInvoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.\n\nI am I!\n\nFrater (I) Nigris (DCLXVI) CCCXXXIII\n'
OldPos 916 | 15 b'From: sommerfeld@apollo.hp.com (Bill Sommerfeld)\nSubject: A little political philosophy worth reading.\nLines: 66\nNntp-Posting-Host: snarfblatt.ch.apollo.hp.com\nOrganization: Hewlett Packard\n\nRead this through once or twice.  Then replace "prince" with\n"government" or "president", as appropriate, and read it again.  \n\n[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by\nDaniel Donno.]\n\n\tIn order to keep their lands secure, some princes have\ndisarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the\ncities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against\nthemselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they\ninitially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have\ndestroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite\njudgements on all of these measures without considering the particular\ncircumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall\nnevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself\nwill allow.\n\n\tTo begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince\ndisarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he\nproceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their\narms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,\nwhile those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they\nare transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,\nnonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by\nextending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of\nthe two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while\nthe former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties\nand dangers should receive advantages.  \n\n\tWhen you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by\nshowing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you\ndistrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.\nMoreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would\nhave to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been\ndiscussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be\ngood enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful\nsubjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired\nstate has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is\nfull of examples proving that this is so.\n\n\tBut when a prince takes posession of a new state which he\nannexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all\nthe subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire\nit; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render\nsoft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of\nthe entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to\nhis original domain.\n\n\t...\n\n\tAnd since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind\nany prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants\nthat he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the\nreason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction\nwith the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to\nkeep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he\nwill carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn\nfrom ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much\neasier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former\ngovernment, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of\nthose who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to\nreplace it.\n\n\n\n\n'

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn\'s rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The primary objective of the\n    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global\n    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially\n    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\n\n\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment.

We\nwere able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the\nPalestinian\'s popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -\ncurrently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous\nstatement: "You look for me !", i.e., I\'am not making any more\nefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid\'s point of view,\nPalestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew\nor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the\nPalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly\nMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from\nresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his\ngovernment\'s and his party\'s lack of action for human rights and\npeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether\nthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists\'\nperspective this is the best government because it is THEIR\ngovernment, regardless of what it does.\n\nThese members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the\nfuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to\ndictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step\ntowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin\'s\ngovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were a\nmarginal byproduct of this "government of peace", which need not\ndisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the "Rabinic"\npolicies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets\nand the significant increases in the number of persons injured in\nthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.\n\nBut the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces\nitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has\nlost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian\nworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel\nAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing\nto propose except separation: Let\'s cut ourselves off from the\nPalestinians, let\'s build a fence so high that they won\'t be able\nto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a\nfence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.\n\nMeron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha\'aretz (4-3-93): "...The\nliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical\nseparation and \'the future of the territories\', must come to\nunderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab\nworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement\ndesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that\ntheir ideological support for separation only provides\n\'humanitarian\' arguments for the legitimization of the <status\nquo>.\n\nEnforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the\nruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears\nits burden. [.....].\n\n"Whoover thinks that \'out of Gaza first\' is a liberal,\nhumanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether\nthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off\nresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to\nthus also disregard responsibility for it\'s creation. It is very\neasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in\nJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at\nthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue\nall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...".\n------------------------------------------------------\n>From The OTHER Front, Jerusalem, 10 March 1993\n\n'

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\n\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\n\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\nunresolved conflict exists.\n\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\nand nations.\n\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\n\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\npolitical means have failed.\n\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\n\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\n\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\n\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\n\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\n\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\n\n\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\ngovernments and international organizations.\n\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\n\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\nattempt to identify some of these:\n\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\n\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\n\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\nabove)\n\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\nattitudes.\n\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\n\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\ndiscussion and enrichment.\n\nElias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND\n\n"
OldPos 894 | 20 b'From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler)\nSubject: The Nicene Creed (was Re: MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY)\nOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\nLines: 152\n\nMichael Bushnell writes;\n\n>The so-called Creed of Athanasius, however, has always been a Western\n>creed, and has always had the filioque.  The Orthodox have said that\n>they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but\n>it is not "in use."\n\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\n\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\nCreed (it wasn\'t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\n\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\nbelow)\n\n\t"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray."\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\n\nand\n\n\t"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\nthrough the Son"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\n\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\na more preeminent way.\n\n\t"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both."\n\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\n\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\nmention of the Son being necessary.\n\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\nposition, which I enunciated above.\n\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone "to produce,\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\nthe Fathers of Nicea."  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\n\n\t"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\nfrom it."\n\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\n\n\t"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him\'; and again it\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\nis none of His.\'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,\' and that `He shall\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\'"\n\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\n\n\t"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\nFather,\' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,\' and `will\nreceive of mine,\' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\n\t"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\nis the Spirit created."\n\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\n\n\t"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\nSon, His Sources."\n\t-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\n\n\tThus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\nnot enough to bring up the "proceeds from the Father" line of the Creed\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does\nnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does\nproceed from the Father.\n\nAndy Byler\n'

Is this function a constant=\n12 hours? Is it truly symmetric about the equator?

If it is\nrun more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X\nserver and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program\nhave exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by\nemptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits?\n- Disclaimer: Please note that the above is a personal view and should not \n  be construed as an official comment from the JET project.\n'
