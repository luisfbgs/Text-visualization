The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:\n\nA/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to\n200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed\ninputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the\nsame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate\nmust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits\nat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national\nInstruments, at the same sample rate.\n\nD/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of\nthe 4 output channels has its own converter.\n\nThe price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface\nboard (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP\'s is $2695.

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\n\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \nat reduced brightness. \n\nBe sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires \nin a safe manner!\n"

If you don't want to hear\nthe transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator\nis the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,\nTHEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.\n\n\tIt used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors\nin switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few\nthousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which\ndrives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices\nare cheaper than relays.\n\n\tJohn Whitmore\n"

I\'d be interested in the cost per megabyte and the\n>approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.\n\nI think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren\'s fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.

But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.

If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)\'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can\'t allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

There are three wires to control how you want turbo\nto become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think\nthe middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire\nconnects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two\nwires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate\ntwo wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.\n\nLED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which\nway the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,\nif the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the\nboard, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard\nis like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't\nlight, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the\nlab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it\n(as long as my advisor doesn\'t catch me - which is easy enough to do), but \nstamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review \ncommittees and the peer review process in general.

And a damn good thing to.\nFlights of fantasy just don\'t have much chance of producing anything, at \nleast not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to\nruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with \nfleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project\nthat actually has a good chance of producing some results.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,\n\n _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________\n|                                                              |\n| Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    |\n| Hewlett-Packard Co.

I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?

(Around 5 MB.)\n\nI have a Quadra 950. \nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\n         (using block-mode transfers)\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\n\nLet\'s say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\n\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\n\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \n\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\n        ...\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\n\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho\')\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n--David\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| David Blume            | "I get tired thinking of all the things I  |\n| dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don\'t want to do."  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n'

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

(As usual, the current edition of\nthe Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the\npriest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be\nrequired.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.  Note that while a Catholic priest is required\nfor Catholics, the Catholic church does recognize marriage between\nbaptized non-Catholics as valid without a priest.  --clh]\n'

11 b'From: shd2001@andy.bgsu.edu (Sherlette Dixon)\nSubject: Was Jesus Black?\nOrganization: BGSU\nLines: 43\n\nThe people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly,\ntoo arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to\nsee any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

14 b'From: jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas)\nSubject: What\'s in a name?: the sequel\nOrganization: Kulikauskas home\nLines: 57\n\nI\'ve been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, \nI think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of \netymology.  I\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\' and \n`Christian\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn\'t disown me but they didn\'t completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, "As far as I\'m concerned, you still are a Jew." \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\'t like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\'t assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \nChristian\' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \n\nJayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org\n'

This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.

If you want \'meaning\'\nwhy not just join a cult, such as in Waco? The leaders will give you\nthe security blanket you desire.\n\nlarry henling   lmh@shakes.caltech.edu\n'

I\'d be interested in the cost per megabyte and the\n>approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.\n\nI think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

[However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

6 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Clipper Launch Article\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 40\n\nTo All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..\n  \nFrom the March 1993 "Aero Vision" (The newsletter for the Employees\nof McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).\n  \n  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY\n  \n  "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.\n  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.\n  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and\n  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed\n  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force\n  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for\n  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were\n  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria\n  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the\n  cafeteria.\n  \n  Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the\n  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the\n  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude\n  of 300 feet.

7 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents\' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe\'re going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t\nsustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let\'s not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\n\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\n\n\n'

BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now and\nI think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leaves \nevery day for two weeks for treatment.  Thus I bought the prescribed tablets\nat some drugstore, but to cure it I must get INJECTION of <Streptomycin>, with\na dose of 1g every 12 hours, for at least 10 days.  I can probably buy the \ntools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF\n!\nCan any kind people here tell me:\n\nIf it's possible to do it? Can I do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hip\nonly??  Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON!!

The first and easiest to fix is\ninterference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or\nother electrical device.  Try moving the system to another location to fix\nthat problem.\n\nSecond, because of the scan rate of the monitor, it tends to synchronize with\nroom lights and can cause the interference you are seeing.  Try turning off\nall lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.  If not,\ntry moving the system somewhere else.\n\nA third solution would be to get a 14" Apple Color Display - It should not\nhave the same problem the 12" Color is more suceptible to.\n\nYou can try calling Apple\'s new support number (in the U.S.) at 1-800-SOS-APPLE.\nThis number is for ANYONE who has questions regarding Macintosh setup and\ncompatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on Monday,\nApril 5, 1993.\n\nGood luck -\n\n****\nKevin Lohman, Buyer, University Book Store\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle\nApple Computers for Education Program\n'

All they\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\nafter all IS the bottom line. \n\n\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \n\n\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\n\n\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \n\n\n\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\n\n\n\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\n\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\ndegree.\n\n\n\t\t\tSincerly,\n\n\t\t\tTim Scanlon\n\n-- \n\ntfs@gravity.gmu.edu\n"

You pull the floppy and\nhard drives out of the old one, stick them in the new one, and you\'ve got\nan LC III.\n\nThe IIvx -> C650 may be the same thing.\n\nIt might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that\nApple only sells Macs pre-packaged with the drives.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

We\'ll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It\'s only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan\'t really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey\'re going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they\'re in the `correct\' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I\'ve picked out.\n\nHere\'s my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I\'ve had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I\'m pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! (\'Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\'re not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\'re sitting upright and\n\t  we\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\'re\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\'d holler, "SLOW DOWN! I\'M SCARED" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I\'ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn\'t help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON\'T DRINK SOAP!

(BTW, as of a\ncouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750\nGSX\'s and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren\'t ripped off is that\nmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-\norder types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily\nby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep \nthem honest about acquiring parts. \n\nFor Harleys and rice-rockets, you\'ve got 2 different situations. There is a\nHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.\nDitto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these are\nnot as high, comparatively. For the \'rockets\', anytime a bike goes down, the \nplastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It\'s fairly easy,\nthen, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap it\non a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit. The other parts,\nmore traceable, can be used, or discarded if they are too traceable.\n\nMike\n-- \nDisclaimer - These opiini^H^H damn! ^H^H ^Q ^[ .... :w  :q  :wq  :wq! ^d  ^X ^?\nexit X Q  ^C ^? :quitbye  CtrlAltDel   ~~q  :~q  logout  save/quit :!QUIT\n^[zz ^[ZZZZZZ ^vi  man vi ^@  ^L  ^[c  ^# ^E ^X ^I ^T ? help  helpquit ^D  ^d !!\nman help ^C ^c :e! help exit ?Quit ?q CtrlShftDel "Hey, what does Stop L1A d..."\n'

When\ngraphed, these define the \'flight envelope\' of that aircraft,\npresumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the\narea on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft\ndoesn\'t fall out of the sky.

Note, too, that this is\ndone is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally\ncarefully coreographed and just what is going to be \'pushed\' and how\nfar is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,\nsuch as the \'early\' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed\ntaxi tests).\n\nI\'m sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about\nthis process (and then some).\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don\'t speak for others and they don\'t speak for me.\n'

(Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = "dark matter")\n\n  The earth isn\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun\'s image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\'s ether field, which is \nitself in the sun\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The "orbit" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\' images being dragged around\nby the sun\'s ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe "path" is not the same. The moon\'s lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as "earth\'s" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       /     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ /                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\'ve seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that "earth shadow.") Its only the moon\'s image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  "Light-Years" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The "piece" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\'d \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I\'d start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine\'s receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don\'t think you\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\'m curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept \'immortal\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n"advising" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn\'t remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\'s more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery \'adjustment\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, "its chaos!" They \nsaid, "no, its order." He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and \'vanishing\' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\'t eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\'ll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\'s cornered, and then he\'ll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\'re willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn\'t over play his hand, and he won\'t need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don\'t want to be a part of. \n\n  I don\'t claim to be the first to think these things, its just \nthat the others could have been \'pruned\' from our path. Maybe these \nthoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.\n\n  \n \n'

It has a 2\nliter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would\ncause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck).\nWhat can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time to\ntime, but has straightened itself out - until now.  I don't have a tach,\nbut by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast\nas it should be.

The only problem has been that there are so\n   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.\n\n   Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.\n   For folks who have been to previous 49\'er rallies at Mariposa, \n   Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.\n   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.\n   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us. \n   Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early\n   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays\n   for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday\n   with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the\n   awards ceremony.  \n\n   For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on \n   registration declaration of affilitation.

We\'ll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It\'s only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan\'t really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey\'re going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they\'re in the `correct\' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I\'ve picked out.\n\nHere\'s my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I\'ve had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I\'m pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! (\'Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\'re not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\'re sitting upright and\n\t  we\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\'re\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\'d holler, "SLOW DOWN! I\'M SCARED" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I\'ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn\'t help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON\'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!\n'

I\'m sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting\nspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"\nposts.  Not that I think we shouldn\'t hear about the bad deals, but it would be\nnice to hear some good news once in a while.\n\nAfter seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a\nrequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50\nin his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn\'t good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world\'s\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\nones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat\nyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my\nsoftware from him.\n\nBravo, Mr. Miller!\n\n- Kevin Harter\n'

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

For a first-time\nencounter, my *personal* preference would be to deal with a textbook written in\nmy native language.  But if you know German and are in Germany, pick up all the\nreference books you think you can handle.  (I only know these works by\nreputation, since my German is most rusty, but I\'d look at the following books:\nKoehler\'s lexicon, Mandeldern\'s concordance, the Jenni & Westermann theological\ndictionary of the OT.)\n\n> What\'s it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?  Is\n> there a lot of language instruction done?  I really don\'t have a basis\n> for comparison.\n\nThe amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely,\nmostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school.  Presbyterian\nand Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical\nlanguages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral\nprogram in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But\nthere are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the\nattitude seems to be more, "Well, if you\'re *really* interested we\'ll give you\na semester-long course, but we don\'t understand why . . .")\n\nThe pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year\nstudents to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each\nlanguage, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (That is: Hebrew in\nAugust, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.) \nThese courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students,\nI\'d say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work.\n'

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n"Galactic Pot-Healer"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n"A Maze of Death"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n"VALIS"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\n\n"The Divine Invasion"\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n"The Handmaid\'s Tale"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\'s life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\'s right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n"The Bible"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\'ll know what all the fuss is\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\ntrue version.\n\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\n\nPETER DE ROSA\n\n"Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\n(German translation: "Gottes erste Diener.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\'s "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised\nedition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n"The Miracle of Theism", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for\nGod" such as Lelie\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin\'s works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

Do people forget that the IDE was specifically\ndesigned to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen\nIDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times\nit was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When\nyou run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it\nat 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,\nnone of them run at CPU speed.\n\nThe only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to\na caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to\nget a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.\n\n>because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.\n\nI've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYousuf Khan\n"

Asante EN/SC\nadapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the\nnewest drivers from Asante\'s ftp server.\n\nThe problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -\nspecifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the "happy Mac face" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn\'t look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn\'t get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I\'ve had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID\'s of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this?

According to\nthem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised\nKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 \n The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he\nsaid:\n\n"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.\nHis grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh\'s Real name)  she didn\'t raise\nDavid Koresh."\n\nSomeone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a\nlogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.\n\nHere\'s another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that\nthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must\nbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?\n\nI knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how\nmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the "Justification" part\npart of the plan.  That\'s when I knew it would come soon.\n\nBut, back to the plan.  It is considered "Cruel and Unusal Punishment" to\nexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what\'s acceptable.\n\nThey knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\n\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training\nis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were\nsubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical \nagent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.\n\nI have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of\nthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.\n\nWe waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these\npeople 51 days.  \n\nI stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole\nthing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks\nchanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:\n\n"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the\noperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal\nshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt."\n\nIt took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.\n\nOne more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic\nweapons on the premises. \n                                                      \n        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!\n\nTHEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!\n\nStill, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.\nFor all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!\nI hope he gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn article <exuptr.1431.0@exu.ericsson.se>, exuptr@exu.ericsson.se (Patrick Taylor, The Sounding Board) writes:\n> In article <11974@prijat.cs.uofs.edu> bill@triangle.cs.uofs.edu (Bill Gunshannon) writes:\n> \n>>Before you go absolving the BATF & FBI of all blame in this incident, you should\n>>probably be aware of two important facts.\n>>1.

Fixed by removing\n  the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256\n  does just fine.\n- Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a\n  256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning\n  off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics\n  mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.\n  With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the\n  window.\n- The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware\n  cursor). I don\'t know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.\n  Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-\n  for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-\n  unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem?\n- The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode.

However, just in case\nsomething went wrong, I\'m going to describe some of the changes needed\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\nyou\'re not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\nthe section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly".\n\n\n* MSDOS configuration:\n\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\nyou\'ll notice that you\'ll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\n(this is the default setup).  You\'ll also notice that your system runs\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\ncalled, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system\nup.\n\n\n* Windows configuration:\n\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\n"[388Enh]" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I\'m not sure.  If this doesn\'t work for you, you\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\tSystemROMBreakPoint=false\n\tEMMExclude=A000-CFFF\n\n(You probably don\'t need the above lines, though.)  The\n"SystemROMBreakPoint" entry is used to enable support for memory\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\n\n\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\n\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it\'s not, it\'s\nprobably because:\n\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\n\tCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\n\twinning solution.\n\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\n\tbe seen ....\n\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\n("SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS"), you must use\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\nsolutions.\n\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\n\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\n\topinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\n\teither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\n\tSmartdrive.\n\n     2. Use a driver that provides "VDS" services ("VDS" stands for\n\t"Virtual DMA Services").  This is a standard, which is supported\n\tby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\n\tthe 1542) to work with Windows.\n\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\n\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   (Windows needs the "/V386" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it\'s\n   still there).\n\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\ASPI4DOS.SYS\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\n   crash my system, but it doesn\'t.  I asked Adaptec\'s technical support\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\n\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\n   C:\\WINDOWS\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\n\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\n\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\n\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\n   three ways to get a copy:\n\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\n\tkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\n\tdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\n\taround $75.\n\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\n\tcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\n\taround $30.\n\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\n\tfor MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\n\tdifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\n\tincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\n\thard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\n\tof ASPI4DOS 3.1.\n\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I\'ve run various\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\n(this is why the memory tests didn\'t find any problems -- the problems\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I\'m mentioning this just in case\nit isn\'t a hardware problem.\n\n\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\n\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\nSystems Jumbo 250:\n\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\n\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\n   However, I\'ve heard of other people having similar problems, and so\n   I\'m mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\n   1542.)\n\n\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\n\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\nthan necessary.\n\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\n"too large".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec "hogs" the memory too\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\n\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec\'s bus on/off timing.  The\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\nThe "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\nbe done in one of two ways:\n\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the "/n" option.  For example, I use\n  a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tDEVICE=c:\\aspi4dos.sys /n4\n\n  Note that there is NO space between the "/n" and the "4".\n\n* If you don\'t have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\n  program called "SETSCSI.EXE", which is very difficult to find.  The\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\n\n\tsetscsi -n:4\n\n  This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\n  factory defaults.\n\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\n\nDo not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\n\n     Once you\'ve lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores\nshould run faster.\n\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\nstarving memory refresh.\n\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn\'t check to see if there was a\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\n\n\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\n\n     This "problem" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\nHowever, I\'ve heard of other people having similar problems, and so I\'m\nmentioning this just in case it isn\'t a hardware problem just on my\n1542.\n\n     Symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the\ntape head:\n\n1. Backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\n\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\n\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem ("Tape backups/restores take a\n   long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\n\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\n\n5. Too many tape read errors.\n\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\nable to find and use the tape drive.\n\n     I don\'t know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn\'t work well attached to\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don\'t know what the cause really is;\nhowever, if you\'re having similar problems, you might want to consider\ntrying a new floppy controller.\n\n\n***** Sound cards:\n\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\nAdaptec\'s DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\ntape DMA, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\n\n     I\'ve found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\n\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\nAdaptec\'s "bus on" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\naffect this.\n\n\n***** Miscellaneous info:\n\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\nof it is merely information that I\'ve heard or read about, and have not\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I\'m\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\n\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "DB="\n  parameter (e.g., "DB=2"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\n  If you don\'t, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\n  program -- I haven\'t tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I\'m not sure (I\'ve never used a\n  version earlier than 6.00).\n\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter.\n\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I\'m not sure if this is\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\n\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\n  information):\n\n     1. You can buy Adaptec\'s EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\n\tsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\n\tyou can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\n\tAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\n\teverything that you need.\n\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\n\tsame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\n\tdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\n\tthe list price, but I\'ve seen this package sold for around\n\t$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\n\tdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\n\tyou may be better off getting Adaptec\'s EZ SCSI instead.\n\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\n\tobsoleted by Adaptec\'s EZ SCSI kit, but I\'m mentioning it in\n\tcase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\n\tdrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\n\tkit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\n\tMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\n\tthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\n\tboards.\n\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I\'ve heard about are\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\n  following is secondhand information):\n\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\n\tnumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\n\t(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\n\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\n\tprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\n\tdetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\n\trequires, ASPI4DOS.\n\n* I\'ve seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\n\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\n\tCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\n\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\n\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\n\tdrivers).\n\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\n  need this driver before you can use this program).  I\'ve never used\n  this version of GNU tar, but I\'ve heard that it works (I don\'t know\n  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,\n  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:\n\n\tPD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>\n\tASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx\n\tASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10\n\tASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr\n\n  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might\n  have it, if any forum does.\n\n* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are\n  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.\n  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and\n  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work\n  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of\n  BSD Unix).\n\n* In case anyone\'s curious, here\'s an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  Note that I\'m using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS\n  3.0 or 3.0a, I\'d probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  If I weren\'t using ASPI4DOS, I\'d probably use something that looked\n  like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I\n  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still\n  need some way of changing the Adaptec\'s bus on/off times.  The first\n  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version\n  doesn\'t.\n\n\n\x0c\nLocal Variables:\nfill-column:\t72\neval:\t\t(auto-fill-mode nil)\nEnd:\n'

I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the\nright chapter, anyway it is close and I don\'t have a Bible at work to\ncheck with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his\nimpending death and he says that he will be going away and then later\nhe will be with them.  He said something along the lines of "I will\nbe in you and you will be in me."  (Again I cannot provide the exact\nquote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that\nthe Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward\nevent, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.\nIf you look for a person you will be deceived.\n\nIt seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would\nbe a political or military leader and so didn\'t recognize Jesus when\nhe came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth.\nA lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to\nbased on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over\nthe world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like\nwhat the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn\'t like that and\nI see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.\n\nOh and by the way, I don\'t expect it to happen once.  There is no one\nSecond Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ\ncomes into someones heart, Christ has come again.\n\nPeace,\nWill.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n| William Taber         | Will_Taber@dg.com \t  | Any opinions expressed |\n| Data General Corp.    | will@futon.webo.dg.com  | are mine alone and may |\n| Westboro, Mass. 01580 |                         | change without notice. |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| When all your dreams are laid to rest, you can get what\'s second best,   |\n|\tBut it\'s hard to get enough.\t\tDavid Wilcox               |\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven\non the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of\noriginal sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the\nconnection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace\nbased on Godism.  The messiah\'s teachings will build on the foundation\nof the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God,\nthe fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God\'s providence of\nrestoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all\nthe World\'s religions.\n\nMany Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may\nmiss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000\nyears ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish\npeople of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that\nJohn the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was\nElijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even\nquestioned who Jesus was: "is he the one who is to come or do we look\nfor another".

What sets a Messiah apart is\nthat he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but\nachieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born\nsinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God\nthousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God\noriginally intended.  God\'s restoration providence is still not\ncomplete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God\'s\nrepresentative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one\nGod.\n\n> [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, \'Look, here is the Christ!\' \n> or \'Look, there he is!\' do not believe it. \n...\n> Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with \n> great power and glory. \n\n> My understanding of Jesus\' answer is that, unlike his first coming,\n> which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.\n\n> By the way, from Koresh\'s public statement it\'s not so clear to me\n> that he is claiming to be Christ.\n\nWho else in this world is claiming to be the Messiah.

I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor\nvideo card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am\nrunning Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping\nthe program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure\nis very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,\nvery slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.\n\nThe HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it\ndoes not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this\nslow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there\nsomething else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?\n\nThanks.\n\n(You can mail to me directly if you wish, at genek@cs.ucsb.edu).\n'

Some\n>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel\n>(the first is preferrable, of course)\n\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\n\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\nbecause\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\nscanning\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\nsome machines).\n\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\nonce\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant "I\nwant to\nplay a mono sound" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\nthe\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\nof\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\nwant\nto make stereo sound.\n\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\nthe\nIBM don\'t want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\n\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\nhardware,\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\nworks.\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\n700/900/950\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\nonly.\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\nspecification,\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\n\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\n\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn\'t really related.\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\nmachine\nyou have.\n\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\n>Lemmings\n>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\n>Glider 4.0\n>OIDS\nand also\nHellcats,\nSuper Tetris\nOxyd\n(and many more, these are just what I\'ve tested)\n\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\n\n\nOther games you list:\n>Armor Alley\n>Spectre\n>Spaceward Ho!\nand also\nPGA Tour Golf\nCivilization\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\n\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\n\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON\'T CHEAT!\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\ndo,\nbut I\'m going say it anyway.\nStop cheating on sound!\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\nis about to end.\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\nwork\neven better soon, so use it.\n\nIn conclusion:\nTo Doug, it isn\'t a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\nTo Jon, it isn\'t a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\nsound\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\nhardware.\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nDisclaimer number 1:\nI don\'t work on sound here at Apple, I\'m just pretty well informed.\nSo don\'t write me with sound questions.\n\nDisclaimer number 2:\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like "the grace period is about\nto end" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\nallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.\n\nDisclaimer number 3:\nI don\'t speak for Apple, just me.\n\n-Steve Bollinger\n'

OldPos 1203 | 16 b'From: dmcaloon@tuba.calpoly.edu (David McAloon)\nSubject: PLANETS STILL: IMAGES ORBIT BY ETHER TWIST\nOrganization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo\nLines: 234\n\n ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!\n\n  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, \nether sucking structures, AND why we observe "orbital" motion!!\n\n  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic \nwaves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the \nMichelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago. \n\n  I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact \nthat the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the \nearth\'s surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = "dark matter")\n\n  The earth isn\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun\'s image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\'s ether field, which is \nitself in the sun\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The "orbit" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\' images being dragged around\nby the sun\'s ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe "path" is not the same. The moon\'s lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as "earth\'s" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       /     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ /                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\'ve seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that "earth shadow.") Its only the moon\'s image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  "Light-Years" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The "piece" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\'d \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I\'d start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine\'s receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don\'t think you\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\'m curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept \'immortal\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n"advising" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn\'t remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\'s more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery \'adjustment\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, "its chaos!" They \nsaid, "no, its order." He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and \'vanishing\' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\'t eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\'ll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\'s cornered, and then he\'ll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\'re willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn\'t over play his hand, and he won\'t need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don\'t want to be a part of. \n\n  I don\'t claim to be the first to think these things, its just \nthat the others could have been \'pruned\' from our path. Maybe these \nthoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.\n\n  \n \n'

The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of\ncourse is not mentioned. It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms\nto Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.\n\nStill this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.\n\n|>   India\'s papers weighed the pros and cons of helping the West to\n|>identify Pakistan\'s role in promoting terrorism, noting on the one\n|>hand that doing so could "bring ruination to Islamabad\'s Kashmir\n|>cause" but, on the other, could also bring India\'s security apparatus\n|>uncomfortably close to the CIA and the Mossad.  Arab papers continued\n|>to portray Iraq and Libya as being unfairly treated by the UN while\n|>Israel remains unpunished for resolutions which it has violated.\n\nIn the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided\nthat Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with\ndamascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria,\nthe next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to\nLybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the\nUSA would reject them as would any other country.\n\n\n|>   Concerning Northern Ireland, President Clinton\'s message of\n|>consolation to the victims of the Warrington bombing was seen in\n|>British tabloids as signalling a tougher stance by the American\n|>government against violence by the IRA.\n\nThe word is "terrorism".\n\n\nThe problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an\nimage abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests\nthen comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a\nfitting combination of the words "freedom" "dignity" "democaracy" or\nof "terrorism" "dictatorship" etc as appropriate.\n\nThe USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are\nrather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they\nloathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack. \nHardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be\nthe country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be\nmovement it would be easier for the USA to move.\n\nFirst off they could recognise Iraqu\'s responsibility in initiating the\nIran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it\'s oil\nproduction back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment \nIran is above it\'s OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would\nuse it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.\n\nThe Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment \nsimply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need\nwestern technology. \n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker\n'

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\n\n"Galactic Pot-Healer"\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\n\n"A Maze of Death"\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\n\n"VALIS"\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\nunknown but possibly divine origin.

Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n\nMARGARET ATWOOD\n\n"The Handmaid\'s Tale"\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\'s life as she tries to live\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\'s right to own property is revoked,\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\n\n"The Bible"\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

In this\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\'s "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revised\nedition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n\nJ. L. MACKIE\n\n"The Miracle of Theism", Oxford\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for\nGod" such as Lelie\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\nformalistic and better written than Martin\'s works, and refreshingly direct\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n\nJAMES A.

For a first-time\nencounter, my *personal* preference would be to deal with a textbook written in\nmy native language.  But if you know German and are in Germany, pick up all the\nreference books you think you can handle.

Presbyterian\nand Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical\nlanguages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral\nprogram in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But\nthere are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the\nattitude seems to be more, "Well, if you\'re *really* interested we\'ll give you\na semester-long course, but we don\'t understand why . . .")\n\nThe pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year\nstudents to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each\nlanguage, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (That is: Hebrew in\nAugust, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.) \nThese courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students,\nI\'d say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work.\n'

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

It uses freon jets for\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\n\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I\'m speaking\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\n\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \nquantity.

A thermal electric power plant (coal,  \noil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  \nthe turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  \nsteam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  \nsomething else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  \ntype of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  \nunobjectionable).

(There\'s a gripe in the industry\nthat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it\'s\nmore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\nas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \n\n       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\nusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\nway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\nrather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about "thermal \npollution" de-icing a river, said, "Up here, we view heat as a resource".  \n\n       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \npurified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\nthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \ncooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Nagle\n'

Remove the ball, and inside you should see\n(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of\ncaked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully\nscrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*\nYou do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.\nPut the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  \n\nI clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom\nis that when you move the mouse, it seems to "click" along.  If this\ndoesn\'t solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly\nrecommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,\nplace it in your drawer every night or when you don\'t use it to keep\nthe dust off.\n\nPersonally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:\nif your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is \nstreaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice\nthat it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains\nor blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.\n\n-- \n Peter Goudswaard                  _________                     _________\n goudswaa@sfu.ca (preferred)      |         |      __/^\\__      |         |\n pgoudswa@cln.etc.bc.ca           |         |      \\     /      |         |\n pgoudswa@cue.bc.ca               |         |   _/\\_\\   /_/\\_   |         |\n                                  |         |   >           <   |         |\n "There\'s no gift like the present"         |    >_________<    |         |\n    - Goudswaard\'s observation    |_________|         |         |_________|\n'
