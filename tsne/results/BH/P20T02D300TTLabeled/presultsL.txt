OldPos 208 | 10 DDB Los Angeles announced today the launch of its new campaign for Deus Ex: Human Revolution,the highly anticipated third installmen...
OldPos 312 | 11 Don't want to play one that's too long,what with Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike on Wednesday,and Deus Ex: Human Revolution on Friday.
OldPos 1928 | 12 August 11th 2010 Was the day I met Mitch... I regret not taking a picture with him. Fuck. Ill miss going to SS shows.... </3

OldPos 209 | 14 Got email saying my copy of Deus Ex is on it's way. If it arrives tomorrow I will literally stay up all night playing it. No joke.
OldPos 130 | 15 Finished Deus Ex last night.  Should probably stay tight-lipped,but I think I can get away with saying the ending is superb!
OldPos 10025 | 16 Up next well be joined by Sunderland striker Louis Saha as we continue to build up to #safc v #lfc at the Stadium of Light tomorrow evening
OldPos 929 | 17 Mancity strikers Aguero and Dzeko you better thrash Bolton tomorrow night!
OldPos 5853 | 18 @DickieV Verlander is possibly ahead of CC,more SOs better ERA,but CC will bounce back after last night's outing like he always does
OldPos 10582 | 19 @ScoreboardSteve I gave Verlander a slight edge over CC,but after today against Boston,he is no Cy Young material.
OldPos 10408 | 20 @DJBamboozle Well,he's 2nd in the AL in ERA. He has a chance at the Cy Young,though Verlander is probably ahead of him right now
