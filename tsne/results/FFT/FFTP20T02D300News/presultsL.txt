It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.

It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.

The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:\n\nA/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to\n200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed\ninputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the\nsame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate\nmust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits\nat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national\nInstruments, at the same sample rate.\n\nD/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of\nthe 4 output channels has its own converter.\n\nThe price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface\nboard (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP\'s is $2695.

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\n\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \nat reduced brightness. \n\nBe sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires \nin a safe manner!\n"

If you don't want to hear\nthe transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator\nis the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,\nTHEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.\n\n\tIt used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors\nin switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few\nthousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which\ndrives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices\nare cheaper than relays.\n\n\tJohn Whitmore\n"

I\'d be interested in the cost per megabyte and the\n>approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.\n\nI think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

He got very excited, hoping that\nhe\'d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren\'s fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\n>It further at least implicitly advances the position that\n>sciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the\n>context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\n>and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\n>weeded out via the "critical function" of science.\n\nI\'m not sure that it\'s random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n>(Though why this critical\n>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky\'s opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\n>subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\n>of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.\n>This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)\n\nI don\'t agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one\'s jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign\'\'.  I\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it\'s worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is\n>*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\n>resulted in some way from a dream or from one\'s political views simply\n>do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\n\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\nadvanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from\nmodern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\n-- \nMark A.

Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)\'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can\'t allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

(Around 5 MB.)\n\nI have a Quadra 950. \nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\n         (using block-mode transfers)\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\n\nLet\'s say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\n\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\n\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \n\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\n        ...\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\n\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho\')\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n--David\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| David Blume            | "I get tired thinking of all the things I  |\n| dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don\'t want to do."  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n'

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.

(As usual, the current edition of\nthe Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the\npriest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be\nrequired.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

14 b'From: jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas)\nSubject: What\'s in a name?: the sequel\nOrganization: Kulikauskas home\nLines: 57\n\nI\'ve been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, \nI think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of \netymology.  I\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\' and \n`Christian\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn\'t disown me but they didn\'t completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, "As far as I\'m concerned, you still are a Jew." \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\'t like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\'t assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \nChristian\' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \n\nJayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org\n'

I\'d be interested in the cost per megabyte and the\n>approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.\n\nI think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

[However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

6 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Clipper Launch Article\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 40\n\nTo All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..\n  \nFrom the March 1993 "Aero Vision" (The newsletter for the Employees\nof McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).\n  \n  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY\n  \n  "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.\n  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.\n  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and\n  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed\n  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force\n  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for\n  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were\n  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria\n  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the\n  cafeteria.\n  \n  Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the\n  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the\n  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude\n  of 300 feet.

7 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents\' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe\'re going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t\nsustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let\'s not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\n\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\n\n\n'

Strictly,\na 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change\nstate, according to the inputs.\n\nA demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which\nof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are\nthree inputs required.\n\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\nwill be low).\n\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\n\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\nfour enable lines.\n\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\nfour final stage decoders.\n\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

The seller insisted\nthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it\nis bad. Is this reasonable?\n\nBasically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of \nthe thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my\ne-mail address.\n\nI know there is such a risk that you could lose money.

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\n\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \nat reduced brightness. \n\nBe sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires \nin a safe manner!\n"

The "near" means that\nit is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),\nnot that it is "nearly UV."  (I\'m sure you can figure out now just what\n"far UV" is.)\n\nRegular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the\nnear end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the\nvisible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are\ngoing to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as\nfluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV\nsources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The\nshorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.\n\nIt wouldn\'t project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes\nin a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively\ncheap way to create a portable source.

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...\n\n-=-= Wes =-=-\n"

Your 2F2 cap\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\nThe other point is that big electro\'s are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\nthe cold).\n\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\nthat "rolls over" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\n\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\n\nCaveat - I\'m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\'t\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\nconditions.\n\nJohnH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\n\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'

A single chip\nmicro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only\ncosts about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed\nthe whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,\nuse the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely\non the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want\nto try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut\nyou a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.\n\nIf you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of \nmaybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET\nto fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than \nyou can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add\na power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count\nscreams up to 9.\n\nPD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This\napplication is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the \nprogrammer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.\n\nJohn\n-- \nJohn De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?  \nPerformance Engineering Magazine(TM) | Interested in high tech and computers? \nMarietta, Ga                         | Send ur snail-mail address to \njgd@dixie.com                        | perform@dixie.com for a free sample mag\nNeed Usenet public Access in Atlanta?

The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, \nincluding NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port\nand a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.\n  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of\nthese have an FPU.\n  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes\nme now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and "Quadra" comparable\nvideo speed. No idea if it has an FPU.\n  Hope this helps...\n\nBeth Corbo\n'

Might this mean that Saturn has\nconquered the problem?  (I dunno, only driven Saturn 5-speeds)\n\nINPUT, PLEASE!\n\nAnother question:  Any plans for a manual-trans Chrysler LH?\nDoes anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo?\n\n\n"

In the early 80\'s with the\nfuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel\nwas the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage\nthan comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their\n350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big\nmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine\ncould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with\nthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --\nDON"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.\n\nAsk yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,\nLOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper\nin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?\nTrailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?\nNo, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a\n500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.\n\nI own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.\nJust keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline\nengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that \nwhen they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\nand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine\ncosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection\npump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,\nyou never need a tune-up.\n\nIf you\'re looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I\'d say you got a great deal.\nCheck to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.\n\nGood luck.\n'

Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\'s special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\'t work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can\'t go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\'t tell you all the things I\'ve tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.\n-- \nGary H.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.

Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign\'\'.  I\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it\'s worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the\nlab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it\n(as long as my advisor doesn\'t catch me - which is easy enough to do), but \nstamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review \ncommittees and the peer review process in general.  In today\'s world that\'s \nwhat determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to.\nFlights of fantasy just don\'t have much chance of producing anything, at \nleast not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to\nruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with \nfleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project\nthat actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD\'s seem to \nbe particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.  \n\n>(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\n>electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.

It *does*\n>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are\n>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and\n>which are not.)\n\nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\nthere\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people call\nTHIS science?"   (My opinion, for what it\'s worth, is that one sees both\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \n\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\'t believe it is \never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \n\n\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\n\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \n\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\'s not  as it is a \nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\'s results is an\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\n\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\ninvestigation.  \n\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \n\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\namount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as I\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \nspecific question to try and answer.  \n\nThe "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \nI certainly wasn\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \nof "reason and observation."\n\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \n\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \nis any existing research related to this question.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\n'

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

I sold my (well maintained)\n'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.\nAll that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings\nand seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,\n\n _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________\n|                                                              |\n| Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    |\n| Hewlett-Packard Co.

However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on\n\nThe original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new\nwizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print\nGrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer\n(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not\npossible).\n\nThis is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to\nApple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It\nis Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.\n\nSEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour\nversion, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the\n'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it\ngave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).\n\nThere is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older\ncomputers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been\nupgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal\nwith Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult \ntime in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).\n\nJust one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT\nGrayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to\ndo so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300\nis NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).\n\nPhil Ryan\nMelbourne, Australia\n"

Other information\n\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n\tuseful when used with Windows.\n\n\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\n\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\n\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \n\tto pay up for RSI management tools.  \n\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tRAN Enterprises\n\tOne Woodland Park Dr.\n\tHaverhill, MA  01830, US\n\tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally\n\tdisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\n\tanimated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the\n\tcorrect rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training \n\texercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions\n\tyou do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help \n\ton workplace ergonomics.  \n\n\tQuote from their literature:\n\n\t"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic\n\tsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work\n\tall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent\n\tRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve\n\tyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these\n\thelp you to become more relaxed and productive."\n \n\t"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.\n\tGodnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup\n\tfor a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to\n\tpromote healthy and efficient computer use. \n\t\n\tCost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts\n\tfor resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\n\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\n\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\n\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n\tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not\n\trequire any sound hardware.\n\n    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tVisionary Software\n\tP.O.

Warns you to take a break\n\twith dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises\n\tto do during breaks, and information on configuring your\n\tworkstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;\n\tquantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is\n\tbought in from another company, apparently; not sure how\n\tequivalent this is to the Mac version.\n\t\n\tThe Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher \n\tMagazine (Feb 1991).

Its user interface\n\tdesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.\n\texpensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only\n\ttool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it\n\ton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!\n\tDoes not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does \n\thave the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,\n\twhich is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.\n\n    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)\n    Available from:\n\tEmail to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)\n    Description:\n\tThis is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you\n\tto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously\n\ttyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI\'s \'load=\' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your \'run=\' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can\'t get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don\'t know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty\'s (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \n\n-- \nDan Wallach               "One of the most attractive features of a Connection\ndwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces\nOffice#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet." -- CM Paris Ref.

As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON\'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand\'s Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): "Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner\'s Guide".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn\'t have your hands):\n(note: you\'re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you\'d expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they\'re not necessarily "the problem."\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here\'s the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you\'re exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou\'re completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you\'re typing too much, you\'re never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath\'s ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you\'ve got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  "Sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as \'neural tension\', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there\'s a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you\'re under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It\'s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can\'t sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what\'s best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I\'m lifting it almost verbatim from\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\n\n. Let your shoulders relax.\n. Let your elbows swing free.\n. Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don\'t flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don\'t slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don\'t like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that\'s right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "Just Chairs."  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn\'t be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be "right there".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It\'s\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There\'s always more information out there.  If you\'d like\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I\'ll gladly throw it in.\n\nIf you\'d like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\nwonderful!  I\'d love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I\'d\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I\'d love somebody to edit the\nabove sections, looking for places where I\'ve obviously goofed.\n\n==6== References\n\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n        2. X terminals\n        3. NeXT\n        4. Silicon Graphics\n        5. IBM RS/6000\n\t6. Other stuff\n\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n\n\tIf you\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\n\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\'re going to have a hard time finding\n\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\n\truns the X window system, you\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\n\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\n\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\n\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\n\n\tThe two main programs I\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\n\n\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\n\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\n\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\n\tserver can do this, run \'xdpyinfo\' and see if any of these strings\n\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\'t have this,\n\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\n\tor bugging your vendor.\n\n\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\n\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\'t seen it.\n\n\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\n\n    2. X terminals\n\n\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\n\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\n\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\n\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\n\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\n\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\n\n    3. NeXT\n\n\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\n\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\n\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\n\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\n\n    4. Silicon Graphics\n\n\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\n\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\'t\n\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\'s not\n\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\n\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\n\tdetails.\n\n    5. IBM RS/6000\n\n\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\n\tUnfortunately, you can\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\n\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\n\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\n\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\n\tworks.  However, they don\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\'ve been  ||\n\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\n\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t    ||\n    \n    6. Other stuff\n\n\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\n\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\n\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\n\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\n\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\n\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\n\n\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\n    Sales offices all over the place.\n\n    Availability: February, 1993\n    Price: $219\n    Supports: Mac only\n\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\n\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\n\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\n\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I\'ll have a detailed blurb from\n    TidBITS available there.\n\n\nFlexPro Keyboard\n    Key Tronic\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\n\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\n    Price: $489 (?)\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\n\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It\'s\n    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both\n    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.\n    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.\n\n    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will\n    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.\n\n\nDragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)\n    Dragon Systems, Inc.\n    320 Nevada Street\n    Newton, MA  02160\n\n    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200\n    Fax: 617-527-0372\n\n    Shipping: Now.\n\n    Price: DragonDictate-30K -- $4995 (end user system)\n\t   DragonWriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)\n\t   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.\n    \n    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only\n\t\t   (3rd party support for Mac)\n\n\tFree software support for X windows is also available -- your\n\tPC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a\n\tserial cable or network.

They sell you\n    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number\n    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.\n\n    Each user `trains\' the system to their voice, and there are provisions\n    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.

You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.\n    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between\n    words.

Each of the four main fingers has five\n    switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  The thumbs have\n    a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles\n    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is\n    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.

The layout resembles the\n    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each\n    section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."  Each section\n    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each\n    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three\n    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each\n    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections\n    flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).\n\n\nKinesis Ergonomic Keyboard   206-455-9220\n    206-455-9233 (fax)\n\n    Kinesis Corporation\n    15245 Pacific Highway South,\n    Seattle, Washington 98188, U.S.A.\n\n    Shirley Lunde (VP Marketing -- contact)\n\n    Shipping: Now.\n\n    Supports: PC.

OldPos 9268 | 15 b'From: mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu (Mark Riordan)\nSubject: List of large integer arithmetic packages\nOrganization: Michigan State University\nLines: 285\nNNTP-Posting-Host: scss3.cl.msu.edu\nSummary: C functions to do arbitrary-precision arith\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\nThis is the file BIGNUMS.TXT from ripem.msu.edu, last updated April 1993.\n\nIn response to Email requests, I have assembled this list of\nlarge-integer arithmetic packages of which I have heard.\nMost of these are C function libraries, available in source form.\n\nFor your convenience, I have placed copies of\nsome of these on ripem.msu.edu (35.8.1.178).  They are\navailable for anonymous FTP in the directory "pub/bignum".\nHowever, what I have may not be the most current version in all cases.\n\nHere they are, in no particular order:\n\nmp\n    Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes\n    \n    Multiple precision package accessed via -lmp flag on your\n    compiler.  Provides +, -, *, /, gcd, exponentiation,\n    sqrt.  Comes with SunOS, NeXT Mach, BBN Mach 1000, \n    and probably a few others.  See "man mp".  \n    Object code only, of course.\n\nPARI\n    Henri Cohen, et al., Universite Bordeaux I, Paris, FRANCE\n    \n    Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines.\n    Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020, \n    semi-optimized code for SPARC, and apparently rather slow\n    generic C version.  Does both integers and reals.\n    Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars.\n    Contains a number of advanced functions, some of which I\'ve\n    never heard of.  ("Weber\'s function"?)\n    Has a factorization function, primality test, & other related stuff.\n    Plenty of TEX documentation.\n    Public domain, but you can\'t distribute modified versions.\n    Available via anonymous FTP from math.ucla.edu.  There seem to\n    be Mac- and NeXT-specific versions there in addition to:\n    Filename:  pari-1.35a.tar.Z\n    \nArithmetic in Global Fields  (Arith)\n    Kevin R. Coombes, David R. Grant\n    \n    Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or\n    polynomials over finite fields.  Includes basic +, -, *, /\n    and a few others like gcd.  Source code in C.\n    Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license.\n    Includes man pages and TEX documentation.\n    Filename:  arith.tar.Z\n\nArbitrary Precision Math Library\n    Lloyd Zusman   Los Gatos, CA\n    \n    C package which supports basic +, -, *, /.  Provides for radix\n    points (i.e., non-integers).  Not as polished as the others here.\n    Posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1988.\n    Filename:  apml.tar.Z\n    \nBigNum\n    J. Vuillemin, INRIA, FRANCE, and others.\n    Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab (DECPRL)\n    \n    A "portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer" package.\n    C code, with generic C "kernel", plus assembly "kernels" for\n    MC680x0, Intel i960, MIPS, NS32032, Pyramid, and of course VAX.\n    This is probably one of the better-known packages of this type.\n    Implements +, -, *, /, mod, plus logical operations OR, AND, XOR.\n    Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available.\n    Available via email from librarian@decprl.dec.com.\n    You will receive 5 shell archives.  Give your postal address\n    and you will also receive printed documentation from France.\n    Package includes TEX documentation.\n    Publicly available for non-commercial use.\n    I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL\n    doesn\'t like others to distribute it.  However, BIGNUM *is*\n    distributed as part of ecpp (see below).\n\nLenstra\'s package\n    Arjen Lenstra   Bellcore\n    \n    Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C.\n    Includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, mod, primality testing,\n    sqrt, random number generator, and a few others.  The package\n    was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough\n    comments to get by.  This is the only of these packages that I\n    have actually used.  It works well and is very portable.  \n    I haven\'t done any benchmarks against the others, but the code \n    looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist.\n    Unlike the other packages here, this one requires you to allocate\n    storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are really huge.\n    Arjen has placed the code in the public domain.  \n    Filename:  lenstra.tar.Z\n\nlenstra_3.1\n    Arjen Lenstra,  Bellcore\n\n    An improved version of Arjen\'s package above.  This one\n    does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned\n    off as an option). Has a few new routines, too.  "lenstra_3.1" contains\n    minor bugfixes to the previously-available "lenstra_2" and "lenstra_3".\n    Filename:  lenstra_3.1.c\n\nbmp  (Brent\'s Multiple Precision?)\n    R. P. Brent\n\n    1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating &\n    fixed point arithmetic.  Includes most of the mathematical\n    functions you\'d find in a FORTRAN run-time library.\n    This code is an ACM algorithm, number 524.\n    To obtain, send a mail message to  netlib@ornl.gov\n    containing the line "send mp.f from bmp" or better yet, perhaps\n    just start with "help".\n\nSPX\n    Kannan Alagappan & Joseph Tardo, DEC\n    \n    This is a huge prototype public key authentication system\n    based on RSA.  I mention it here because those who have heard\n    of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large\n    integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer\n    package it contains is indeed DEC\'s BigNum from France.\n    You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2). \n    Use it only for testing, as it "may" expire on a certain date.\n    (I don\'t know whether this has expired yet.)\n\namp  (Antti\'s Multiple Precision?)\n    Antti Louko   alo@kampi.hut.fi\n\n    Multiple precision integer package in C.  Includes +, -, *, /, %,\n    pow, mod, 1/x mod y, random, sqrt, gcd.  Available for non-commercial\n    use.  The package includes "share-secret", a public key system based\n    on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.\n    This is normally part of the well-known "des-dist.tar.Z",\n    but I have removed the DES part to avoid having to deal with \n    cryptographic export laws, and have named the result:\n    Filename:  amp.tar.Z\n\ngennum  \n    Per Bothner   U of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n    C++ routines and classes to do generic arithmetic, both\n    integer and rational.  \n    Formerly available on sevenlayer.cs.wis.edu.

Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and\nwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller\ncard on my ISA 486-50.\n\nI'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.\nAnd I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)\nabout buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting\nsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).\n\nHow would this\nnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and\nthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?\n\nObviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would\nYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?\n\nAlong those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I\nwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?\nAnd how much would it cost?\n\nI actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook\nup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.\nActually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and\nown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a\nSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI\nHD's SCSI-2?\n\nThanks for any comments.\n\nRandy\n  \n"

Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and\nwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller\ncard on my ISA 486-50.\n\nI\'m currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.\nAnd I\'m thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)\nabout buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I\'m getting\nsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this\nnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and\nthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?\nObviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would\nYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?\n\nAlong those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD\'s if I\nwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?\nAnd how much would it cost?\n\nI actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook\nup a SCSI HD through it\'s SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.\nActually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and\nown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a\nSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI\nHD\'s SCSI-2?\n\nThanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.\n\nRandy\n  \n'

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

Note that its effective\nresolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. If you don't intend\nto magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true 256 level gray scanner would\nwork better for images.\n\nI've seen the ScanMan go for as little as $100 used. It is a reasonable buy\nat that price. Higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used\nflat bed scanners. Here is Seattle, the paper shows occasional good bargains\nin the classifieds. Used color flat beds have been seen as lows as $500 lately.\nGrey scale flatbeds come in around $300-$350. \n\n"

However, the "gifted one" can\n>only hear himself speaking in his own language.\n>\n\nThere seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which\nare problematic.  It\'s use as prayer language seems especially troubling\nto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing\nthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is\nGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go\nby the Pentecost use where it\'s an actual language.\n\nMoreover, the phrase "though I speak with the tongues of men and angels"\nused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then\nassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it\nis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.\n\nHmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how\nGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that\nif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one\namongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.\n\nSo why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE\nANOTHER?  It\'s disturbing to think that some people find ways to \njustify jabbering.\n\nBut I\'ll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.\n\nTrouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at\nverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that\nthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright\nfabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post\nseems like a "friend of a friend" thing.  And linguistically, a two\nsyllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.\n\nMuch as many faith healers have trouble proving their "victories" (since\nmost ailments "cured" are just plain unprovable) and modern day\nressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that no\nmodern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.\n'

Sure, there are some who want glory\nfor themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those\nwho do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian\nchurch also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all\nwho speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.  \nI would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges \ndo so more often in private prayer than in public.\n\nLink Hudson\n\n[There were apparently those in the early church who claimed that\nat Pentecost the miracle was that the crowd were all given the\nability to understand the Apostles speaking in Greek.  --clh]\n'

Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\nextremes before stopping at "moderation."  I think we have seen the extreme of\nthe "hell fire & brimstone" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\nsensibilities.\n\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\npoint of telling him that he didn\'t believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\nwouldn\'t do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don\'t believe in\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn\'t\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn\'t\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\n\nI\'d use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. \nWhen I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that\nisn\'t called, oi vey!.

As the\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\nis still of the old creation.

In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  \n\nI have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I\nwould say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its\neternality.\n\n1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.\n2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.\n   If responsible, then he is also accountable.\n3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.\n4) Christ.

How does the\n>suggestion relate to Isaiah\'s prophecy of the birth of Christ by a virgin? \n>I don\'t see any cycles in that prophecy.\n\nMaybe cyclical is not the best word.  That is one aspect of it.  In the\ncase of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and\nalso prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would \ncease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of \nChrist.\n\nSeveral prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the\ntime they were made.  "Out of Egypt have I called my Son" refers both\nto Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   "Why do the heathen rage"\nwas said of David and also of Christ.  \n\nAnother example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, "and his bishoprick\nlet another take."  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His\ndisciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews, "the children thou\nhast given me."\n\nHow does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.\n\nLink\n\n\nLink Hudson.\n'

The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, \nincluding NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port\nand a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.\n  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of\nthese have an FPU.\n  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes\nme now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and "Quadra" comparable\nvideo speed. No idea if it has an FPU.\n  Hope this helps...\n\nBeth Corbo\n'

I\'m pretty much\noblivious to any current firmware problems, so you\'ll have to get it\nfrom someone else.\n\nHowever, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the\nRockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.\nThis is because the MPU used "speed buffering" instead of having a\n16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts\nare still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking\nconditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the "speed buffering"\nworks OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial\nport board.\n\nHope this helps...\nTom\n\n-- \n|Tom Barrett (TDBear), Sr. Engineer|tom.barrett@amd.com|v:512-462-6856 |\n|AMD PCD MS-520 | 5900 E.

There is no much of\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine\'s conclusion ;-) ), so it\'s hard to make\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\n\nBuddy Christyono\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsummary of replies\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello Buddy,\n\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\n\nHere is my suggestion...\n\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\n\tDOS 6.0\'s compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\n\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\n\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \n\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\n\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\n\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\n\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\n\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\n\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\n\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the "A" is better than "B" \n\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\n\tI am looking forward to being able to "LOADHIGH" the DD sw.  That\n\thas been an annoyance.\n\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\n\teffort to upgrade.\n\nJust my $.02 ...\n\nRegards,\nMark Bagdy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nBuddy,\n\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\n\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\nsuch).\n\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\nhappy camper.\n\n-Bruce\n-- \n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\nregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. \nThere was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.\n\tCompression performance for the whole disk has held steady \naround 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files \nare compressed image files and some large zip files.  \n\nIf you have any more specific questions let me know.\nDan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI bought it an have been happy with it.

The problem is that\nonce the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added\nto the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We\nwould like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for\nfurther use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:\n\n (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize\nprecisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it\'s a compressed\nformat - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the\noffending header.\n\n (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF? It would be\nreally nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. ;)\n\n I\'ve already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which contain\ngraphics formats documentation, with no luck. So, if you know, or knwo\nsomeone who knows - please email! Thanks.\n\n'

I am saying that UI designers must carefully\ndistinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must\nultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. \n\n\n   I don\'t recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be\n   categorized as a "symbol manipulator".\n\nIt would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this\nclaim. At any rate, I don\'t think this is evidence that 20% of users think\nlike programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---\nthese are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol\nmanipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not\nrequired to do what they do. \n\nTo restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;\nno, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.\n'

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars?

I still believe\nthat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would\nnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent\nthe many hours in Stanford\'s Med Library as I have done.\nAnd 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that \nwould help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank\ngoodness I didn\'t.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine\nthat helps me.  \n\nI think that what you\'ve said is kind of idealistic.  That you\nwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second\nopinion, and then move on with your life.\nJust as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in \nthis field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.\nThese are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over\nthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going\nto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was \nhelpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very\nunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,\nmake phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.\n\nA recent movie, Lorenzo\'s Oil, offers a perfect example of what\nI\'m talking about.  If you haven\'t seen it, you should.  It\'s not\na put down of doctor\'s and neither is what I\'m saying.  Doctors are\nonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us\nout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing\npiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\n\nI guess I\'m biased because dizziness is one of those weird things\nthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,\nor failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That\'s because \nthose things are much more tangible and have much more concise \ndefinitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to\ndecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to\nfind your way out of it.\n\n\nI have chosen the latter.\n\n\nLinda\nlindae@netcom.netcom.com\n\n\n>\n>-- \n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and\n>geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon." \n>----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n'

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".

First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n'

It uses freon jets for\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\n\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I\'m speaking\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\n\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \nquantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I\'ll try to get you\nin touch with our ground crew people.\n\nCheers,\nCraig\n\n--\nDON\'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!\n'

Michael, thanks for the generous\noffer, but we have quite enough dreams of our own, thank you.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are letting your own dreams go to waste by\nfailing to get the maths/thermodynamics/chemistry/(your choices here)\nwhich would give your imagination wings.\n\nJust to show this isn\'t a flame, I leave you with a quote from _Invasion of \nthe Body Snatchers_:\n\n"Become one of us; it\'s not so bad, you know"\n-- \n \',\' \' \',\',\'  |                                                  |  \',\' \' \',\',\'\n   \', ,\',\'    |       Del Cotter       mt90dac@brunel.ac.uk      |    \', ,\',\'  \n     \',\'      |                                                  |      \',\'    \n'
