I have\nused Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource\nconverter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially\nthe naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.\nWith windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance,\nthis doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK,\nand Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So \nyour constructor should know how to convert a #define into the\nproper resource identifier.\nI'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does\nuse resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to\nport to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel\nfor anything ) \n\n\n\nAlex.\n\n\n--\n__  __|       \\      __|       Alex Colburn                  \n   |       /   \\    |          Image Analysis Facility      \n   |      _____ \\   __|\t       University of Iowa          \n______| _/      _\\ _|          colburn@tessa.iaf.uiowa.edu  \n"

The three problems I see are:\n\n  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.\n  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.\n  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the\n     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.\n\nBeing more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these\nlimitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff\nfloating around blithely accept what they\'re given?  I could write\nthe server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, \nbut I\'d rather avoid this if not necessary.\n\nI know there are no absolutes, but I\'d appreciate hearing people\'s\nopinions and suggestions.

Windows will use a swap file\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\nthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book\nthey handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended\nswapfile".  I\'ll quote the information\n\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\n  of RAM on your machine.\n\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\ntelling you what little he knew.\n\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren\'t actually\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\nyou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick\nup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.\nThat is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You\ncould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself\nI sprang for Word.\n\nWell, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone\nwill go to a workshop and save a little money.\n\nAnd if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.\nI need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)\n\nThanks,\nBrent Casavant\nbcasavan@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu\n\n'

This particular product\nuses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent\nPC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation\nprocessed PS.\n\nThe quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for\nthe PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.\n\nWe were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was\naccepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts\nthe image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript\nprocessor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is\nresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our\ncamera images came out very good in my opinion.

The problem was not the resurrection\nwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population \n(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was\nthat Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the\nstate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism \nbecomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,\nand were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,\nand hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since\nChristians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is\nseen by Nero\'s blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let\'s not cloud the\nissues with the resurrection.\n\nrandy\n\n[I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically\nbecause they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did\ncause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus.\nOf course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other\nthan a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians\nscholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event --\nin effect, a delusion.  --clh]\n'

There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the \nFuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There\nused to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in\nTexas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.\nControllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses\nthough.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but\nI think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,\nif you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.\nCheers,\nCorwin\n'

The first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of\nCasablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little\ngrainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it\nhad 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.\n\nI consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many \nother formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don\'t know what\nkind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy\nthat showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.

Whenever I save an icon which contains dark\ncolors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the\nbright colors. This happens with every icon editor including the image\neditor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP files\neither; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is with\nthe icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the file\nwith a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing the\ncolormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I can\nfix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem? \n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n--\nSadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nCenter for Reliable and High-performance Computing\ne-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu\n"

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

1 b'From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office \nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 71\n\nI have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\'d GIF images contain charts outlining\none of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in\nCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I\'ll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as \n      the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun\n'

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"
3 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'
4 b"From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)\nSubject: Re: Guns for Space\nKeywords: Sopa Gun, Space Launcer\nOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL\nLines: 72\n\n\nOkay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"

Both spacecraft will team up with\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\n     Japan\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\nwhile within view on Earth.\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\'s project manager for the\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\n     "One of our main activities is developing the methodology\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\ncelestial objects," said Smith.\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\n     "There is a long history of radio astronomy using\nground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is to\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy."\n     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galactic\nnuclei, you\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\nthan you would expect."\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\nthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look further\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\'s\nparticipation in the project.\n     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians have\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\nscience mission.\n     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"\nhe said.\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\nambitious project, JPL\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\n     "Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\nscientifically exciting missions."\n                           ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.\n\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\n'

April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n\t"Basically what we\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."\n\n\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n\t"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n\t"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"\nHeflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives."\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour\'s June flight and Discovery\'s July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.\n\n- end -\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\'s. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\'s minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development."\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\nprovided by the Agency.

You\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity -\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\nwho consider themselves "christians" are (even those who manage to head\ntheir own "churches").

No one can browbeat you\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\nmodern offshoots like the "new age movement" teach or does he require God\'s\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\nsome people it did comprise their life\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you\'ve never read "A Pilgrim\'s\nProgress," I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\n\n>Peace and Love\n>In God(ess)\'s name\n>James Moss\n\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\nwrote that "I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\nof the teachings of christ".  Well, Christ referred to God as "My Father",\nnot "My Mother", and while the "maleness" of God is not the same as the\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\npopulation.\n\nWell, I\'m not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\narticle.

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\'s actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\nfall...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\n'
17 b"From: bfinnert@chaph.usc.edu (Brian Finnerty)\nSubject: Mary's assumption\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 34\n\nA few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\nearth:\n\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.\n\nBrian Finnerty\n"

McCord)\nSubject: Questions from a newbie\nOrganization: University of Virginia\nLines: 56\n\n\n\tIs life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a\ncurve?\n\tI\'m new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to\nknow what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\nhe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\nAlso, are we "graded" by those around us, or has there always\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person\'s childhood taken\ninto account?\n\tI\'m sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\nmost of you, but I figure that you\'re the experts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-Quinn\n\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\nthat\'s because our primary source of information is prophets and\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\nboth Jesus\' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like "even XXX will be better\noff than you in the judgement."  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\nto the Bible and "Holy Tradition" of a more generic Christian sort.\n\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\nus from the results of a test that we couldn\'t possibly pass.  If you\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it\'s easy to\nsee why you\'d be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\n\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\nhow far God\'s cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don\'t\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\ndescription of how to be saved, but it\'s not clear to me that he\nprovided an exact description of how he\'s going to place the dividing\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can\'t expect to know whether\nother individuals are saved or not.\n\n--clh]\n'

Massive amounts of regolith would\nhave to be processed.\n\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo\'s claims some time ago about the moon\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn\'t\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth\'s crust,\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\n\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; "high-Ti" basalts (Apollo 11\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\nbasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\nmined today).\n\n\tPaul F.

This powers up the\n   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.\n3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.\n4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.\n\nThings to check:\nFirst check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical\noutput transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most\ncommon cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn\nsomewhere.\nAlso look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),\nif you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator\nthen it shouldn\'t be too hard to find the problem from there.\n\n'

A\n    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,\n                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free\n    country..."\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of\n    the militia): "Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n    a year."\n\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing\n    armies): "... if circumstances should at any time oblige the\n    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be\n    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large\n    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their\n                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****\n    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens."\n    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBut *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn\'t mean the PEOPLE when they\nsaid "people", right?

That\'s why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that\nwas to insure the People could form a "well regulated Militia", not a\n"well organized militia".\n\n> It could be\n> argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last \n> part.

He\nonly wrote it.\n\n> The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with \n> the security of a free state.

The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we \nshould accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even \nworse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence \nzones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di\nminished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd\nwonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the \ncity, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right.\nAs for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault.

Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems.

This impressive change in the province\'s ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." \n (See also Map 1.

You can generally tell the difference\njust by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,\nit's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're\nprobably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware\ncursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible\nthat the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually\nchecking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just \nthat.\n\nIn reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless\nof what the server returns.\n\n-joel\n"

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

On the drawing you have a set of\nreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  \n\nNow you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron\nDanon\'s excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which\nconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click\nthe mouse.\n\nUpon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come\nout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways\nfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because the\nscanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are\nsuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and\ncontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,\nscanner errors and what have you.\n\nThe errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global"\nadjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or\nrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.\n\nSo the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for\nremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of\npoints \n\nReference(x,y) (the known true values)\n\nDistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)\n\nDistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)\n\nwhat function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to\nDistortedData to remove the errors.\n\nI suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted\nreference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3d\nsurface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to remove\nthe errors in the other data points.\n\nAny kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,\npointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?\n\nThanks,\n\nEarl\n\n\n'

They\nalso give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in PostScript\nenvironments where it is absent.\n\nThe suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints\nof a line using the following formula for each coordinate:\n\n\tnew_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25\n\t\nDoing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  From\nreading I thought that what they might actually do is:\n\n\tnew_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25\n\t\nThis results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" \nwhichever is closer.\n\nBy doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that\nneither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS\nresult looks better than how my stuff looks, I\'d like to know if\nanyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.\n\nThanks,\n\n--Steve\nsqueegee@world.std.com\n\n'

If you want\nless quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable\nyou could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This\nrequires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could\nprobably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply\ninstruction and a few other DSP things.\n\nIf you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a\nsecond (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000\n8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1\ncompression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about\nV.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.\nNow add in the time for your encryption method.  You\'re going to need\nsampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a\nPC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they\'re so popular and cheap\n- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the\nSoundBlaster is that it doesn\'t seem to be full duplex - you can\'t\nsample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation\na bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be\nrequired.\n\nThe only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the\nSoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that\nI don\'t have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can\'t\nestimate how fast a PC you\'d need.\n\n\n-- \nNot all men who drink are poets.

Also, my math is frequently noted for\nbeing wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.\n\nI assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and\none stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes\nper second is 1.44K.\n\nLet's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in\nstereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a\nNyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if\nyou think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A\nconverter will probably not present you with a signal that has been\ncut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher\nfrequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome\nthat problem.)\n\nOn the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,\nyou could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and\nthen linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,\nbut it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in\nthat respect.

Is\nit because too many people take French and German in college to make\nthe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.\nSince the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when\nthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors\nwere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength\nrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized\nmedicine approaches like Britain\'s National Health Service.\n\n>"`You\'ve got to remember, you\'ve got a waiting list as well, but it\'s  \n>not as obvious.

Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\n\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada\'s\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\n\n>WOULDN\'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  \n>FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  \n>\n>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  \n>care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  \n>hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  \n>insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  \n>a month.  \n\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\nbenefits, they\'ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\ncovered for basic care.\n\nAt that point, they wouldn\'t even consider a "voucher" approach\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\n\n>******************************************************************  \n>\n>WOULDN\'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  \n>ACHE AND PAIN?  \n>\n>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  \n>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  \n>bills.  \n>\n>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor\'s -- have a lower  \n>per-person health bill than we do.\n\nIt is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\nnaifs will proclaim that it\'s free, along with the Canadian Left for\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\n\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine\'s Summer \n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \n1-30 days, you\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\n\n>ISN\'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  \n>AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  \n>\n>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  \n>"politically thorny," in the quiet words of one advocate for a  \n>national plan.

The government provides free health care to all U.S. \n>residents. And there are no out-of-pocket costs. \n\nWrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine\'s Summer 1992 edition\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\nyou\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\nfor the U.S.\n\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\njust a few people have to be reminded that it\'s not free (the average\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\ncounterparts on issues like these).\n\nI\'m one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, \'cos the 100%\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn\'t know\nit, you\'d believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren\'t worried about the\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we\'re worried about the French and Germans\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\nshouldn\'t be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn\'t spiralled out of control despite\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\nspend all of your benefits\' worth, and more if you can ... we\'re a\ndifferent culture.\n\n>Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two \n>elements of the current health care system that reformers most often \n>criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the \n>employer-based system of coverage.

Insurance companies, doctors, hospitals and other health \n>care providers then bid for the pool\'s business, competing- in \n>theory- on the basis of price and quality. \n\n"Managed Care" relies on HMO\'s, which are unknown in most western\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\nand Germany (I\'m Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\nof HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!").\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\ndoctors with budget strings.\n\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO\'s.  The divisions\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\n"sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by their\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\n\nWith such an open-ended system, it\'s no surprise that Canada is #2 to\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The\nFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations\nin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.\n\ngld\n--\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGary L.

I am in\nthe process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I\nfound two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the\nsame price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that\'s\nthe brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron\n(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB\nmotherboard.\n\nI said that this might be a silly question since I believe that\nMicronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never\nheard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because\nmy impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines\nand they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better\nwarrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have\nrecently aquired Edge Technologies and I\'m not sure how much I should\ntrust the company.\n\nI would REALLY appreciate any input on this.

Unfortunately, this\nwould be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy\nanimation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.\n\n\tOtherwise, see if your local public access cable\nstation has equipment that you can use.\n\n'

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I\'ll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as \n      the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun\n'

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"
OldPos 3 | 4 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]\n\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\'s idea -- Any Takers?\n'

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"

It\'s more likely that the Moon will never\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\nmaterials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \nand it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat \nsink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\'s a very minor \nactivity in the global scope of things.\n\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\n\nWe don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\ncenturies, if not much longer.\n\nLuna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again. There\'s little glory in watching from a\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little\nultimate profit either.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n'

Space Science\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\ngenerate interest in the project. I\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\nthe meeting. Here goes : \n\n\t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\n\t\t\t-------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \'conventional\' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n3.Missions\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\nrate.\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\nsunlight could be imaged.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\n\n\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\n    scintillation proportional counters.\n\n\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn\'s rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\n\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned\n    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to\n    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have\n    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data\n    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from\n    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve\n    approximately 70% of its original objectives.\n\n\t   Galileo Schedule\n\t   ----------------\n\t   10/18/89 - Launch from Space Shuttle\n\t   02/09/90 - Venus Flyby\n\t   10/**/90 - Venus Data Playback\n\t   12/08/90 - 1st Earth Flyby\n\t   05/01/91 - High Gain Antenna Unfurled\n\t   07/91 - 06/92 - 1st Asteroid Belt Passage\n\t   10/29/91 - Asteroid Gaspra Flyby\n\t   12/08/92 - 2nd Earth Flyby\n\t   05/93 - 11/93 - 2nd Asteroid Belt Passage\n\t   08/28/93 - Asteroid Ida Flyby\n\t   07/02/95 - Probe Separation\n\t   07/09/95 - Orbiter Deflection Maneuver\n\t   12/95 - 10/97 - Orbital Tour of Jovian Moons\n\t   12/07/95 - Jupiter/Io Encounter\n\t   07/18/96 - Ganymede\n\t   09/28/96 - Ganymede\n\t   12/12/96 - Callisto\n\t   01/23/97 - Europa\n\t   02/28/97 - Ganymede\n\t   04/22/97 - Europa\n\t   05/31/97 - Europa\n\t   10/05/97 - Jupiter Magnetotail Exploration\n\n\n    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made\n    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,\n    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon.\n\n\n    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire\n    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity\n    map.\n\n\n    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.\n    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in\n    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for\n    one martian year (687 days).\n\n\n    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched\n    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the\n    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global\n    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially\n    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\n\n\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical\n    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.\n\n\n    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron\n    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro\n    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).

OldPos 5 | 13 b'From: baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (Ron Baalke)\nSubject: JPL\'s VLBI Project Meets with International Space Agencies\nOrganization: Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nLines: 112\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\nKeywords: VLBI, JPL\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \n\nFrom the "JPL Universe"\nApril 23, 1993\n\nVLBI project meets with international space agencies\n\nBy Ed McNevin\n     Members of JPL\'s Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry\n(VLBI) project team recently concluded a week-long series of\nmeetings with officials from Russia and Japan.\n     The meetings were part of "Space VLBI Week" held at JPL in\nearly March and were intended to maintain cooperation between\ninternational space agencies participating in the development of\nthe U.S. Space VLBI Project, a recently approved JPL flight\nproject set for launch in 1995.\n     U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft\n-- the Japanese VSOP (VLBI Space Observing Program) satellite\nwith its 8-meter radio telescope, and a Russian RADIOASTRON\n10-meter satellite. Both spacecraft will team up with\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\n     Japan\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\nwhile within view on Earth.\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\'s project manager for the\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\n     "One of our main activities is developing the methodology\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\ncelestial objects," said Smith.\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\n     "There is a long history of radio astronomy using\nground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is to\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy."\n     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galactic\nnuclei, you\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\nthan you would expect."\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\nthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look further\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\'s\nparticipation in the project.\n     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians have\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\nscience mission.\n     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"\nhe said.\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\nambitious project, JPL\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\n     "Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\nscientifically exciting missions."\n                           ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened\nto your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn\nV\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!\n\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\nAmerican.  Let\'s go fly it!\n'

April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n\t"Basically what we\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."\n\n\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n\t"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n\t"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"\nHeflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives."\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour\'s June flight and Discovery\'s July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.\n\n- end -\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'
OldPos 159 | 16 b'From: baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (Ron Baalke)\nSubject: SIRTF Mission is Still Alive\nOrganization: Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nLines: 114\nDistribution: world\nNNTP-Posting-Host: kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\nKeywords: SIRTF, JPL\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \n\nFrom the "JPL Universe"\nApril 23, 1993\n\nSIRTF is still very much in business\n\nBy Mark Whalen\n     In these times of extra-tight NASA budgets, the very\nsurvival of a number of missions has been uncertain. But thanks\nto major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL\'s\nSpace Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major project\nconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is "alive\nand well," according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.\n     A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have\nadded up to a less expensive project with "tremendous scientific\npower" and a bright future, said Werner.\n     Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful Infrared\nAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer\n(COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for\ninfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000\nor 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.\n     IRAS\' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10\nyears ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never\nbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25\ncomets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than\nany previously available from ground-based observations. COBE has\nmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large\nangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.\n     But to illuminate SIRTF\'s potential, Jim Evans, JPL\'s\nmanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,\nrecently said that the project is "1,000 to 1 million times more\ncapable than IRAS," based on technological advances in infrared\ndetector arrays.\n     However, despite the enormous strides in infrared\nexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as the\nhighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s\n(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a "diet or die"\ndirective from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project\ngoing, according to Werner.\n     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the key\nfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the sun\ninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocket\nlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. "The\nmain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your\nlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don\'t have to\ncarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit," Werner said.\nThe other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that "it\'s in a\nbetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth."\n     Additional major changes in SIRTF\'s redesign include\nshortening the mission from five to three years and building a\nspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original\nplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)\ncompared to Titan SIRTF\'s 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).\n     All of that adds up to "a less stressful launch\nenvironment," Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200\nmillion for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the\ndesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.\n     Werner said SIRTF\'s redesign came as a result of Congress\'\ntelling NASA "you\'re trying to do too many things. If you want us\nto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to see\nhow it fits into (NASA\'s) overall strategy."\n     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA\'s highest\npriority "flagship" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary\nSpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessing\nfrom the National Academy of Sciences.\n     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping\nto keep the project alive, SIRTF\'s major scientific contribution\nalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector\narrays, which will allow images to be developed "tens of\nthousands of times faster" than before, according to Evans.\n     "Up until a couple of years ago," Werner said, "all infrared\nastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays\nof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Department\nof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or\nhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and\nthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF."\n     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget\npressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an\neye out for any "technological spinoff."\n     "On that question, I think we have some things to say," he\nsaid, "because the detectors we\'re using are straight off various\nmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.\naerospace industry, and it\'s a real technological and engineering\nchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.\n     "SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,"\nWerner added, but the revised three-year mission "puts a premium\non observing time. We have to educate the user community and\ndevelop a program that involves early surveys and quick\nturnaround of the data."\n     Werner said the downsizing of the project required a\nreduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF\'s three instruments --\nthe infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband\nimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result in\nlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.\n     The project hopes to start a "Phase B" activity in 1995,\nwhich will provide a detailed concept for development and design.\nBuilding the hardware would begin about two years later.\n     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950\nmillion.\n     "I am very optimistic about SIRTF," he said. "It will\nprovide a tremendous return for the investment."\n     Werner added that an additional benefit from the project\nwill be the "enrichment of our intellectual and cultural\nenvironment. People on the street are very interested in\nastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other\nplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of\nquestions SIRTF will help answer."\n                              ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents\' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe\'re going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t\nsustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let\'s not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\n\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\n\n\n'

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.\n\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\n'

When work for a large program like\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won\'t be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\'t), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term \'center tax\'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else."\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\'t post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I\'m supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of \'center tax\', or \'wrap\' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \'tax\'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter \'taxes\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\'t if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don\'t have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1/3, but it\'s only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question "What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don\'t go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\'t eaten\nup by the center tax?)"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my \'home\' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the \'tax\' does not all\ngo into a \'slush fund.\' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \'general\'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn\'t go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is \'billable\' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\na burecratic nightmare!\n\nMy last point is that I can\'t believe your claim that\nCongress has never heard of the term \'center tax.\'\nUnfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before\nCongress isn\'t on a computer, so I can\'t do a simple\nword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,\nin some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods\nwere documented for Congress?\n'
OldPos 21 | 20 b'From: dbm0000@tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov (David B. Mckissock)\nSubject: Washington Post Article on SSF Redesign\nNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    \nNntp-Posting-Host: tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov\nOrganization: NASA Lewis Research Center / Cleveland, Ohio\nLines: 52\n\n"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be\nImpossible"\n\nToday (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the\nheadline shown above. The article starts with "A leader\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\nbe impossible." O\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\nmeaningful research "is a real question for me."\nO\'Connor said "everything is fair game," including\n"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\nmanned space shuttle fleet."\n\nO\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\ninto three categories based on cost.\n\nThe Post says O\'Connor described the design derived\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\nlistened in on part of O\'Connor\'s briefing to the press\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\'Connor\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\nCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\'Connor say\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\nthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).\n\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\nas "one features modules that could gradually be fitted\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."\n\nThe last sentence in the article contradicts the title\n& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He\n[O\'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned\nspace station Freedom is still possible within the\nadministration\'s budget guidelines."\n\n'
