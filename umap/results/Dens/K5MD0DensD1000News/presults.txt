I don\'t argue\nthat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I\njust question whether you >should<.\n\nThe fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we\ncan\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I\nreally hope I do, but I\'m not holding my self-similar breath.\n\n> There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal\n> image compression.\n\nUh huh.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  I\'ve been chasing fractal\ncompression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so\ngreat, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t,\nI\'ll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first\n\tencoding devices in the summer, he says.

Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic\n>phil. of sci. texts as an example of the inventive component of\n>hypothesizing. \n\nAnd has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-\nBernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

I would offer some rather well known examples\nsuch as Toricelli\'s Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air"\nhypothesis.

Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)\nout of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and\nwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.\nThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty\nat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, one\ncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new\ndomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you\nlike.\n-- \nGary H.

However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

The Bible "ends"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God\'s reign end there ?

This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.

However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.

The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

2 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

In other\nwords, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,\nnavigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. \nYou wouldn\'t want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I\'d hate to see\nfolks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch\nsystem comes on line.\n\nI guess I\'d simplify this to say that \'waste\' is a slippery concept.  If\nyour goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its\nnot \'wasted\' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500\nmillion, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.\n\nCraig\n\n\nCraig Keithley           |"I don\'t remember, I don\'t recall, \nApple Computer, Inc.     |I got no memory of anything at all"\nkeithley@apple.com       |Peter Gabriel, Third Album (1980)\n'

17 b"From: szabo@techbook.com (Nick Szabo)\nSubject: SSF Redesign: Constellation\nSummary: decentralize & automate functions\nKeywords: space station, constellation\nArticle-I.D.: techbook.C51z6E.CL1\nOrganization: TECHbooks --- Public Access UNIX --- (503) 220-0636\nLines: 89\n\nSSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

I was just wondering if we could have some kind\n>of update on DC-X.\n\nWell it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting\nready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out\nof town (in NM).\n\nAs for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work\non SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have\nsome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital\nprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for\nanother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with\nmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a\nset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.\n\nBetter news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of\nthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next\nyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.\n\nNow not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made\nfor spending half on DC.\n\nPublic support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I\'ll\nhelp you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media\nans get them to cover the flight tests.\n\n   Allen\n-- \n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Lady Astor:   "Sir, if you were my husband I would poison your coffee!"   |\n| W.

That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.

I\'ve been chasing fractal\ncompression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so\ngreat, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t,\nI\'ll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\n\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \nat reduced brightness. \n\nBe sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires \nin a safe manner!\n"

By default the parallel\nprinter processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore\nno Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,\nthus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.\n\n     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not\nroute interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software\nusually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port\nactivity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably\ngetting the sound card slighty confused!.\n\nWindows may be a different story....\n"

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

This\nis definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the\nstock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI \naccelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,\nNew Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.\n\nI added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive\ntower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto\nwhich I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally\nterminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems\noccur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two\ninternal hard drives.\n\nIt works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.\n\n"

The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the "happy Mac face" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn\'t look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn\'t get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I\'ve had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID\'s of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this?

We\'ll be riding some twisty, \n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\n\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It\'s only above, say, 45 MPH that you \ncan\'t really communicate.\n\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\nthey\'re going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\nand WHIP AROUND until they\'re in the `correct\' position.  This always\nscrews up the line I\'ve picked out.\n\nHere\'s my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\n\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\n\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\n\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I\'ve had people try to dismount\n\t  in traffic, just as I\'m pulling in to a parking space!)\n\t- Muffler gets HOT! (\'Nuff said)\n\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\'re not going to fall over.  (Many\n\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\n\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\'re sitting upright and\n\t  we\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\'re\n\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\n\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \n\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \n\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\n\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\n\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \n\t  thing -- I\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\n\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\n\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \n\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \n\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\'d holler, "SLOW DOWN! I\'M SCARED" \n\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \n\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\n\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\n\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\n\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \n\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\n\nUsually I\'ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\n\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\nIt doesn\'t help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \nfirst trip!\n\nGood luck -- have fun!\n--\nDON\'T DRINK SOAP!

I have heard \ncomplaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control \nproblems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.\n\nThere was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not \nmatch up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the \nfrequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that \nthe NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter \nand the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable \npincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness \nwhen I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the \ncontrols.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the \nraster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome \nas the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.\n\nI have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold \nthrough OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that \nway at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has \nmy vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if \nit's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to \nbuy.\n\nI have no experience with the Nanao.

See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Back\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

It is evident that the West, especially America,\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\'s\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\nresponsible for his decision to invade.

It is precisely the lessons the world learned\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\n\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\n\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\non what origins we are talking about.\n\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\n\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of "higher\ntruth" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither "higher" or \n"lower"; they are simply true.\n\nMore to the point, restricting one\'s discussion of origins to science\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\nscope of discussion.\n\n4) This is a false premise.\n\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\n\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\n\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.

At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos\nthe military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from\nthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially\nafter the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It\nseemed to me that they didn\'t have the stomach for the reality of war,\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It\'s like\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was "nice and clean" (smart\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.

The second bomb could\'ve been held back\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\n\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\'s\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.

If some back-water country took over some other\nback-water country, we probably wouldn\'t intervene.  Not that we don\'t\ncare, but we can\'t be the world\'s policman.  Or if a coup had occured\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn\'t have acted\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\'s oil \ninterests, caused us to take action.\n\n> \n> [ I\'ve moved a paragraph from here to later on ]\n> \n\n[...]\n>> \n>> If we hadn\'t intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\n>> have been appeasement.\n> \n> Right.

I\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\'t\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\'t see it as\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\n\nBut don\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\ndon\'t!

Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\nwasn\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\nof "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \nwe are expected to swallow that "hundreds of thousands" of \n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \nWhat hogwash.  If "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi civilians died, \nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \nthe Allied bombing.\n\nRegards,\n\nJim B.\n\n\n'

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat\nuncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "progress" and\n"rationality" in science.  Since I\'ve addressed these issues in this\nnewsgroup in the not too distant past, I won\'t go into them again now.\n\nWhat is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the\nimpression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps\neven the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around\nhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and\npetty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that\nsciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the\ncontext in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\nand even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\nweeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this critical\nfunction should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\nIf experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\nsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\nof the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.\nThis is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)\n\nTrue, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is\n*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\nresulted in some way from a dream or from one\'s political views simply\ndo not generalize well to the actual history of science.\n-- \nGary H.

Dog attack!\nOrganization: the HP Corporate notes server\nLines: 30\n\nSeveral years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet\nintersection right in front of me but there was enough distance\nbetween us so I didn't have to slow down. However, a 2nd dog\nsuddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and\nthe force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier.\n\nApparently, it was following the 1st dog. Henceforth, if a dog\ndecides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as\nmany dogs like to travel in pairs or packs. \n\nI've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which\nhas a pretty loud OEM horn (not as good as Fiamms, but good enuff)\nbut the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of\nthe smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble\ngetting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. I'd\ndef feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easier\nleg chewing target for those mongrels.\n\nIf there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite\ncomplaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running\nover it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO\ncompared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the\nground by said dog and dies from a head injury. \n\nAny dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace\nrunning about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate.\n\nGraeme Harrison\n(gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com) DoD#649 \n\n"

I\'m looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would\nlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can\'t afford $700 for it right now.\n\nI\'m considering two basic options:\n\n1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs\n    due to recent price increases, but I\'d imagine over $400.\n    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact\n    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates\n    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.\n\n2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new \n    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey\n    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather\n    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose\n    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper\n    than upper Aerostich.\n\nRequirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other \nlayers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i\'d prefer a zip-out \nlining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, \nshoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a \nreasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would \nbe a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below\nfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.\n\nPlease fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...\n\nSteve\n--\n-- \n Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu\n (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu\n 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250\n "Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry..."\n'

Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

In our case, other\nmonitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be\nspecific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this\nproblem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc\nseveral 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the\njuice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side\nof wall maybe?\nWe started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input\nlines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference\neffect on the computer monitor next to it. \nNow on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very\ncommon, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type\nO'scopes).\nI talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount\naround deflection coil of interfering monitor. \nBE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH\nVOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T\nBLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO\nMOUNT CAN.\nNow, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also\ngood at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on\nmonitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other\nsources.\n\nJeff Babb\nbabb@sciences.sdsu.edu   babb@ucssun1.sdsu.edu\nProgrammer, SDSU - LARC\n"

A technician examined it and \npronounced the disk drive unusable.\n\nMy investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).\nWhen CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.\n\nI use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.\n\nInstall will proceed "successfully", but when I try to boot the server, it\nreports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.\n\nInternal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one\ndisk drive (or at least one large single unit). \n\nAttempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready\nerrors.\n\nQuestions:\n=========\nThe software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen\nSFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II\n(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? \n\nSo how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?\n\n1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what\nis causing my serialisation error?\n2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of\nwhich has failed?\n3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not\nbe serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?\n4. What else can cause a serialisation error?\n5. What happens if the keycard fails?\n6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments\nand guides.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nApology:\n=======\nI appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I\'m\ndealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I\'m hoping that by casting\nmy net further, I\'m more likely to capture someone who has met this system\nbefore.

I\'m sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting\nspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"\nposts.  Not that I think we shouldn\'t hear about the bad deals, but it would be\nnice to hear some good news once in a while.\n\nAfter seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a\nrequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50\nin his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn\'t good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world\'s\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\nones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat\nyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my\nsoftware from him.\n\nBravo, Mr. Miller!\n\n- Kevin Harter\n'

This is in response to a question about\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\n\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\nmention of Mary\'s _blessedness_/full of grace in the "Annunciation" by\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\n\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\'s\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _"Hail,\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\n art thou among women."_\n\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - "the Lord is with Mary &\nblessed art thou among women" - while you read on....\n\nIn the book, "First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\nDevotion to Mary" by Peter Lappin:\n\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\nthat the feast of _Mary\'s Conception_ under the title "The Conception\nof Saint Anne", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\nis the incorruptible timber "out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\nof Christ\'s sinless body"; she is "God\'s Eden, in whom there is\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms."  Her perfect\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\nshe was hailed as "innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve".\n...\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\n...\n\nNow let\'s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\nFrom "Pocket Catholic Cathechism" by John A. Hardon:\n\nBaptism -\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\n\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\n power to think and to choose freely.\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\n title to enter heaven.\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\nfreely.\n\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam\'s\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\nbodies on the last day...\n\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the \'puzzle\'):\n\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary\'s birth but\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel\'s greetings was:\n"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\nBlessed art thou amongst women".\n\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\n\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\n                definitely want to be with those He\n                has made _blessed_)\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\n\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\nand blessed_ as the \'tabernacle\' for the coming body\nof Christ and so,\n\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart. \n\n-Marida\n(P.S.  I do hope that others will continue more\n       light and facts on this matter.  Thanks.)\n'
OldPos 4 | 3 b'From: shd2001@andy.bgsu.edu (Sherlette Dixon)\nSubject: Was Jesus Black?\nOrganization: BGSU\nLines: 43\n\nThe people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly,\ntoo arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to\nsee any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

He is the Prophet who is revealed\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur\'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\'an by Allah\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur\'an, against the message\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\'an is from \nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\n\n\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\n\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\n\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\n\tall things.\n\n---------------------\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\nAllah\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\n"for Allah has full knowledge of all things."\n\n----------------------\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\n\nA   D R O P L E T\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\'an\n\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\n\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n   \t\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \n\n\t\t MU\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \n\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\n\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\ndecree as the Glorious Qur\'an and manifest miracles\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\nOur\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\neffect of the words,\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\'\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\nwhile being observed by Him, \'The true ruler has\nappointed me to such and such position.  \'At a time when\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \'Yes\'\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\nand more definitely than would the word \'Yes.\'\n   In the same way, ALLAH\'s Most Noble Messenger\nclaimed: \'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \'Further he shows\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \'No lie can hide in this\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\'\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\nways.\n   The Wise Our\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.\n\n'

It happened\nin La Salle, France.\n\nThe moral lesson of the story is:\n\nThe Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has \nbeen used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives\nworthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and\nfor the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we \ndisobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger, \nhas been given the task to make us be \'aware\' of the evil\nserpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience\nto God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.   \nThe children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is \nbrought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins, \nto obey God\'s commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence \nof The Lamb.\n\nAs she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the\nSon of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church,\nthe Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are \nprotected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new \nEden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.

OldPos 1159 | 12 b'From: JEK@cu.nih.gov\nSubject: etymology of "Easter"\nLines: 53\n\nfor SRC\n\nIn most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is\nknown as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word\nwhich comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning "Passover." In English,\nGerman, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,\nor some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the\norigin of this term.\n\nOne explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE\nRATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an\nAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\nnot make it more so.\n\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply "Spring\nFestival."\n\nHowever, Bede\'s is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\nKnoblech, in "Die Sprach," ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\n\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\nof the Resurrection was known as "hebdomada alba" (white week),\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\nreferred to simply as "albae." Translaters rendering this into\nGerman mistook it for the plural of "alba," meaning "dawn." They\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\n"dawn." This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n\n\n[No, I\'m not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety\nof celebrating Easter.  However this seems like it contains enough\ninteresting information that people might like to see it.  --clh]\n'

Suppose that that\nchapter had been written with the sexes reversed. We have God\ncreating woman, and then saying, "It is not good that woman should\nbe alone. I will make a help meet for her." Feminists would be\noutraged. The clear implication would be that God had started at the\nbottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and\nbirds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally His masterpiece, the\nMale Chauvinist Pig. The statement that woman is not capable of\nfunctioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her,\nwould have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The fact\nthat the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given\nonly briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was given\nin six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence\nof the author\'s estimate of the relative importance of the sexes.\nThe verdict would have been unequivocal.

According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

This\nis definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the\nstock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI \naccelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,\nNew Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.\n\nI added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive\ntower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto\nwhich I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally\nterminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems\noccur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two\ninternal hard drives.\n\nIt works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.\n\n"

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a\ncurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side\nto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I\nthink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.\n\nAnyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for\npicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a\ncouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an\nefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my\ncar battery in about half an hour).\n\nUnfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic\nspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the\ntemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably\nits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we\nhave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no\nleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the\ntwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more\n(although that would be a lousy way to control it).\n\nWhat I would like to know is:\n\n1: Are the above guesses correct?\n\n2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?\n   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm\n   too fast when I unplug it)\n\n3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

The Mac\ntests memory, etc. Just before the "happy Mac face" normally shows up, the\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\n\nIt doesn\'t look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn\'t get noticed\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has\n*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I\'ve had\nit for over a year).\n\nHere is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID\'s of the EN/SC and the disk --\nseveral permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the\nhead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator\n(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal\nresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another\nidentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.\n\nHas anybody seen this?

Multiple graphs (of the same or\n+  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n+  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n+  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n+  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four\n+  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and\n+  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.\n+  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),\n+  including a portable metafile format and renderer.\n+  \n+  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on\n+  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot\n+  \n+  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n+  \n+  Unix:   SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix\n+  Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT\n+  \n+  Authors: Many.

Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  "Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation."\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It\'s written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\'s environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters\'\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

If I get enough replies, I will\nmake it happen and provide you with the details.\n\nBTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my\nresearch on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this\nservice are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program\nsearches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology\nworks by comparing your question against a set of questions that have\nbeen seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded\nand used to improve the system.\n\nThis database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new\ninformation.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.

I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain.\nHe suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I\nneed to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may\nmonitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.\n\nI did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary).\nI explained to her that I was following up at the doctor\'s request,\nand that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more\nfrequent and the medication did not seem effective.\n\nThe doctor called me back, and his first words were, "Whatever you want,\nyou\'d better make it quick.  I\'m very busy and don\'t have time to chit-\nchat with you!"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to\ncall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I \nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\nhad more time.  He responded, "Just spit it out now because no time is\na good time."  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\nand then said "well, never mind" and he said he\'ll talk to various\ncolleagues about other medications and he\'ll call me some other time.\n\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn\'t express\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I\nwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering\nhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told\nme that he just doesn\'t have time to "rap with patients" and thought\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\n"rap" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\nthis apology: "I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don\'t have a lot of\ntime to deal with that."  He then told me to call him the next day\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\n\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\n\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\nnow I am afraid to call him.\n\n\t\t\t--Marlena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

Now that the fan has Mike\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\nMorning show:\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the "homer" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \'guys\')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\nJets, or St. John\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\nDuring the summer, it\nis all talk on WIP.\n\n\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \n\n\n\n            Rich\n-- \n  "You\'ve read the hat, now see the movie."\n                   -Imus in the morning \n  "A blurb?

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

However, the\nconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I \nsuspect.  I\'m not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic \nbenefit from Lindbergh\'s flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a\nhuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic\nbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed\nand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the \nequivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billion\nfor a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done\nthan because they expect to make money off the deal.\n-- \nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t    "Find a way or make one."\n\t             -attributed to Hannibal\n'

I was referring to the fact\nthat far more aeronautical development took place in the \'30\'s.  For much\nof the \'20\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It\'s important to note that\nthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,\nChamberlin and Levine, and Byrd\'s _America_.

The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),\nOrteig\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in\n1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were\nwithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well\nwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only\na gov\'t could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.\n  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by\ntaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane\nthat could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions\nasked.\n\n-- \n Keith Mancus    <mancus@butch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           |\n N5WVR           <mancus@sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        |\n "Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          |\n  when your back\'s against the wall...." -Leslie Fish                  |\n'

The prefix "peri-" is Greek, not Latin, so it\'s usually used\nwith the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited.  (That\'s why\nit\'s "perihelion" rather than "perisol", "perigee" rather than "periterr",\nand "pericynthion" rather than "perilune".)

Recognizing that most of the military requirements\nfor launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle \never really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure\nout how many, how often, where to, etc...)\n\nThen taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I\nknow... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft\ndesigns.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what\nthe technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to \neliminate designs that can\'t be built today.  And lets say that this\nportion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.\n\nAnd from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the\nintention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall\nstreet, and saying "I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers\nthat show %20 ROI, fund me...)\n\n\nNow many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that\njust this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace\ncompanies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things\nends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS,\nALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european\nspirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements\nthat are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be)\nends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.\n\nAny feedback?\n\n\t\t\tJohn.\n'

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"
