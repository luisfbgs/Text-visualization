It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.

The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:\n\nA/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to\n200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed\ninputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the\nsame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate\nmust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits\nat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national\nInstruments, at the same sample rate.\n\nD/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of\nthe 4 output channels has its own converter.\n\nThe price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface\nboard (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP\'s is $2695.

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\n\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \nat reduced brightness. \n\nBe sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires \nin a safe manner!\n"

If you don't want to hear\nthe transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator\nis the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,\nTHEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.\n\n\tIt used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors\nin switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few\nthousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which\ndrives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices\nare cheaper than relays.\n\n\tJohn Whitmore\n"

I\'d be interested in the cost per megabyte and the\n>approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.\n\nI think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

He got very excited, hoping that\nhe\'d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren\'s fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\n>It further at least implicitly advances the position that\n>sciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the\n>context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\n>and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\n>weeded out via the "critical function" of science.\n\nI\'m not sure that it\'s random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n>(Though why this critical\n>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky\'s opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\n>subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\n>of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.\n>This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)\n\nI don\'t agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one\'s jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign\'\'.  I\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it\'s worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is\n>*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\n>resulted in some way from a dream or from one\'s political views simply\n>do not generalize well to the actual history of science.\n\nIt is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps\nyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out\nfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first\nadvanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from\nmodern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.\n-- \nMark A.

Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)\'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can\'t allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

(Around 5 MB.)\n\nI have a Quadra 950. \nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\n         (using block-mode transfers)\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\n\nLet\'s say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\n\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\n\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \n\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\n        ...\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\n\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho\')\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n--David\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| David Blume            | "I get tired thinking of all the things I  |\n| dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don\'t want to do."  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n'

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.

(As usual, the current edition of\nthe Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the\npriest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be\nrequired.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

14 b'From: jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas)\nSubject: What\'s in a name?: the sequel\nOrganization: Kulikauskas home\nLines: 57\n\nI\'ve been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, \nI think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of \netymology.  I\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\' and \n`Christian\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn\'t disown me but they didn\'t completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, "As far as I\'m concerned, you still are a Jew." \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\'t like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\'t assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \nChristian\' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \n\nJayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org\n'

I\'d be interested in the cost per megabyte and the\n>approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.\n\nI think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

[However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

6 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Clipper Launch Article\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 40\n\nTo All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..\n  \nFrom the March 1993 "Aero Vision" (The newsletter for the Employees\nof McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).\n  \n  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY\n  \n  "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.\n  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.\n  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and\n  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed\n  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force\n  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for\n  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were\n  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria\n  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the\n  cafeteria.\n  \n  Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the\n  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the\n  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude\n  of 300 feet.

7 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents\' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe\'re going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t\nsustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let\'s not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\n\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\n\n\n'

I\'m >philosophically< opposed to it\nbecause of its complexity.\n\nThis complexity has led to some programs\' poor TIFF writers making\nsome very bizarre files, other programs\' inability to load TIFF\nimages (though they\'ll save them, of course), and a general\ninability to interchange images between different environments\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\n\nAs the saying goes, "It\'s not me I\'m worried about- it\'s all the\n>other<  assholes out there!"  I\'ve had big trouble with misuse and\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\n\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\nemphasis mine):\n\n"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\nand that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\nimage-generating applications out there now."\n\n\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can\'t read >every< TIFF\nimage, that means there are some it won\'t- some that I might have to\ndeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I\ndon\'t and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not\nthat anyone does, of course! :-)\n\nab\n'

You'll want version 5.9 or later.  (6.0x is current.)  It allows you to view in 15 and 24 bit modes.  It really is QUITE nice.\n\nNow, for a return question:  Do you run Windows?

The seller insisted\nthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it\nis bad. Is this reasonable?\n\nBasically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of \nthe thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my\ne-mail address.\n\nI know there is such a risk that you could lose money.

And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three \nmonths to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your\ncredit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit \ncard company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them\nfrom me for a cheaper price.\n\nIf you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really\nwish to get this over with.

After you read about\nmy situation, I\'d like your opinion.  Here\'s the scenario:\n\n1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).\n    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both \n    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / \n    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies.\n\n2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible\nsolutions (I\'m sure there are others I haven\'t thought about).  For these \noptions, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees \nany flaws (drive type X won\'t coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking \n(I don\'t know very much about these beasts):\n\n1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.\n    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What\'s a good brand?\n    What do the floppies themselves cost?\n\n\n2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a\n    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any\n    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?\n \n\n3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)\n\n\n4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha\'s or \n    recommendations for manufacturers?  \n\nI appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will\nsummarize all responses for the net.\n\nThanks,\n\nGeorge\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n  George J.

The finance guy then  \nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\n\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \nmistake.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.\n\nMark\n"

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\n\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \nat reduced brightness. \n\nBe sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires \nin a safe manner!\n"

It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization\nof logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to\ndo so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist\nwith 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of\na logic cell array to do the same job.

OldPos 9090 | 18 b"From: martinh@cac.washington.EDU (Martin Hunt)\nSubject: Announcing tcpview: A Motif-based TCP/IP protocol analyzer\nOrganization: UW Networks and Distributed Computing\nLines: 89\nKeywords: protocol analyzer TCP/IP\nTo: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu\n\n\nTcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\n\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\n\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\n\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z\ttcpview and tcpdump source code\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z\tSun4 binaries\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z\tDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\n\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\n- easier interface\n- enhanced protocol decoding\n- hex display of frame\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\n- ethernet address host table\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\n\tprocessing.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\n\nNew features:\n\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the \nfile type will be automatically detected.\n\nCan now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.\n\nThe hex format has been changed.\n\nNew time options have been added.\n\nOptions were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.\n\nBugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)\n\nNew flags:\n-R\tread Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin\n-ttt\tprints delta times\n-tttt\tprints times relative to the first frame\n-W\twrite a Sniffer save file (use with -w)\n-x\tprint frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  \n\tSample output:\n\n16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: S 0:0(0) win 16384\n        0000  45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02   |  E..(....<.|.._p.\n        0010  80 d6 06 64 05 05 00 15 5b 19 4a 00 00 00 00 00   |  ...d....[.J.....\n        0020  50 02 40 00 4e 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         |  P.@.N.........\n\n-X\tprint TCP data in hexdump format (used with -Z)\n-z\twrite TCP data to stdout (use with -t to eliminate timestamp)\n-Z\twrite frames and TCP data to stdout\n\n\nMartin M.

See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\'t work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can\'t go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\'t tell you all the things I\'ve tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.\n-- \nGary H.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

Maybe we don\'t understand completely how it is learned,\nbut training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the \nkey elements in developing it.  \n\nInformal exploration is also often an important element in finding new\nscientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin\'s naturalistic\nstudies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the \ntheory of evolution.  \n\nThis is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes\nempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal\nexploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation\ndoes not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical\nstudies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very\npoor kind of science.  \n\nIn article <1qk92lINNl55@im4u.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu \n    (Russell Turpin) writes:\n>    ...\n>I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes.\n>  ...

If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.

I\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the\nlab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it\n(as long as my advisor doesn\'t catch me - which is easy enough to do), but \nstamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review \ncommittees and the peer review process in general.  In today\'s world that\'s \nwhat determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to.\nFlights of fantasy just don\'t have much chance of producing anything, at \nleast not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to\nruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with \nfleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project\nthat actually has a good chance of producing some results.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.\nYou may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the\ntire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.\n\n(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put\nthem thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as\nsoft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very\noften, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.\n\nBob Benson\n \n"

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

Others claim to be staying of their own free\nwill, but Jobs\' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.\n\nIn conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting\ninformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the\nindustry.  At times, he has claimed to "have hardware which will blow\nanything else away", while more recently he claims they have stopped\nmanufacturing their own.\n\nAgents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is\nequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and\npossibly Canon equipment.\n\nThe siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to\nother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as "Bill" and\nclaims to be the "MS-iah".\n\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\n"interpersonal computing" which rejects traditional roles.\n\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\nfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares\nthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own\napocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers\ncarry Jobs\' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling "I\nwant to welcome you to the \'Next World\' ".\n\n- - -- \nRoland J.

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically\nmodified graphics chips and PIA\'s for the joysticks. Later model 2600\nmight have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight\nof the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.\n\nAdditionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for\ntheir games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I\nwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking\nwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the\n2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).\nAlso I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into\na RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to\nbackup cartridges). I\'ve heard of a setup like this where games could\nbe bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them\ninto a special RAM cartidge, and play them.\n\nAnyways, if you\'re interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we\'ve got\ntwo 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa\ncartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and\nhandling. Don\'t play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo\n(interested in that too?).\n\nHope that helps your question... I might grab some 6502\'s out too,\nsince they must be fun to play with (as microcontrollers).\n-shishin "squish" yamada\nsquish@endor.harvard.edu\n'

I asked in these groups some time ago\nwhat about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother\nwho lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I\'m still trying to get\nused to it.\n\nBefore I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS\nprogrammer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just\nsome exercises from university). I used to make some programs in\nMicrosoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries\nthat required that. \n- I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,\n  specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never\n  felt confortable with it.\n- TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the\n  ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I\n  will try something more complex.\n- It works nice even in my "weak" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram. \n\nBut.....\n\n- The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version \n  from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual\n  have more itens than in the manual.\n- I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother\n  as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I \n  suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it\n  will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to\n  me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...\n  who knows.\n\nSo, I\'d like to ask some questions for you all;\n\n- I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is\n  there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can \n  contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask\n  for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ?\n- Is there anybody else using it around here ?\n- Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen\n  to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself. \n\nAnswers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRafael.\n\n\n'

OldPos 9682 | 4 b"From: brownli@ohsu.edu@ohsu.edu (Liane Brown)\nSubject: DOCTRINE OF GOD\nOrganization: Oregon Health Sciences University\nLines: 111\n\nThis is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this \ndoctrine:\n\n\n                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD\n\n\nI.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\n     be to know God.\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\n\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\n         6:3.\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\n         unlimited power over all creation).\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\n         regarding salvation.\n\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  In creation\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\n          Heb. 1:3.\n     B.  In salvation\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\n         active in salvation.\n         1.  God, the Father\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\n             important works:\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\n             following ways:\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\n\n\n----------------------------------\nLiane Brown\n(Internet) brownli@ohsu.edu\nPortland Oregon\n"

I think basically the reasoning was that the\ntradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus.\nAs the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was\nmore and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin\nfor life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)\nSince we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\na predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\nbecause she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science\ndiscovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\nMary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\n\nMary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \nrefered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \nwould have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\nto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nRCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that\nbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.

OldPos 899 | 7 b"From: bfinnert@chaph.usc.edu (Brian Finnerty)\nSubject: Mary's assumption\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 34\n\nA few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\nearth:\n\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.\n\nBrian Finnerty\n"

Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new\nchurches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,\nchapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word\n"throne" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the\nassignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are\nalready judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no\nrecourse, excuse or defense.\n>\n>I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God\'s love with \n>putting into words and explaining that love.  Preaching the Gospel \n>without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a \n>clanging cymbal.\n\nYes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\nextremes before stopping at "moderation."  I think we have seen the extreme of\nthe "hell fire & brimstone" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\nsensibilities.\n\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\npoint of telling him that he didn\'t believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\nwouldn\'t do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don\'t believe in\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn\'t\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn\'t\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\n\nI\'d use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. \nWhen I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that\nisn\'t called, oi vey!.  What\'s with that ref that he didn\'t make that call. \nIt\'s unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\nis still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness\nwhich includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,\nthen broad is the way to distruction.\n\n>\n>Here\'s a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are \n>afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God\'s love?\n\nI think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,\nrepentance isn\'t only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!\nNo, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we\nshould do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  \n\nI have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I\nwould say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its\neternality.\n\n1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.\n2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.\n   If responsible, then he is also accountable.\n3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.\n4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to\n   the "whosoever will."\n\n--Rex\n'

It is a\nbit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I\'d share it with all of you\nanyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might\nbenefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.\n \n=======================================================================\n \n                   D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?\n \n \nQ. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,\n   tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, "God Loves You."  Isn\'t\n   that true?\n \nA. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read\n   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:\n \n      For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten\n      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but\n      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16\n \n   However, God\'s love is qualified.  The Bible says:\n \n      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he\n      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9\n \n      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of\n      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6\n \n \nQ. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good\n   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How\n   can these verses apply to me?\n \nA. By  God\'s  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is\n   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The\n   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.\n   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before\n   God.\n \n      As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There\n      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after\n      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11\n \n      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately\n      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9\n \n \nQ. If I am such a wicked person in God\'s sight, what will God do to me?\n \nA. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will\n   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.\n \n      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\n      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,\n      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap\n      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They\n      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\n      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of\n      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24\n \n \nQ. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not\n   that bad.\n \nA. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-\n   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible\n   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal\n   and consists of perpetual suffering.\n \n      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was\n      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15\n \n      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\n      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall\n      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and\n      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50\n \n      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with\n      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them\n      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\n      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting\n      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory\n      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9\n \n \nQ. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?\n \nA. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be\n   accountable to God for his actions.  God\'s perfect  justice  demands\n   payment for sin.\n \n      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23\n \n      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;\n      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,\n      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10\n \n      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\n      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n                                                       Matthew 12:36\n \n \nQ. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought\n   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?\n \nA. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our\n   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our\n   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus\n   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.\n \n      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one\n      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of\n      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6\n \n      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\n      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;\n      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5\n \n      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also\n      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the\n      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the\n      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4\n \n      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that\n      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was\n   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about\n   Hell anymore?\n \nA. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it\n   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.\n   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.\n \n      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he\n      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath\n      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36\n \n \nQ. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that\n   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to\n   Hell?\n \nA. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our\n   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole\n   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to\n   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins\n   and serve Christ as our Lord.\n \n      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,\n      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and\n      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n                                                        Matthew 6:24\n \n      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be\n      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the\n      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except\n   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their\n   followers also go to Hell?\n \nA. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-\n   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other\n   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their\n   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and\n   save us.\n \n      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none\n      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be\n      saved.                                               Acts 4:12\n \n   Jesus said:\n \n      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the\n      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6\n \n      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us\n      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n                                                          1 John 1:9\n \n \nQ. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?\n \nA. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You\n   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see\n   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.\n \n      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\n      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,\n      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13\n \n      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe\n      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...\n                                                       Acts 16:30-31\n \n \nQ. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?\n \nA. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He\n   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that\n   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.\n \n      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of\n      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8\n \n   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,\n   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you\n   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is\n   the only Word of God.\n   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented\n   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.\n \n      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of\n      God.                                              Romans 10:17\n \n \nQ. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?\n \nA. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging\n   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.\n \n      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a\n      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17\n \n   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin\n   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we\n   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins\n   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to\n   Hell.\n \n      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him\n      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his\n      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26\n \n \nQ. Doesn\'t  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be\n   baptized?  Will these save me?\n \nA. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.\n   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God\'s\n   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-\n   ure.  Salvation is\n \n      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9\n \n \nQ. What else will happen at the end of the world?\n \nA. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed\n   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-\n   more.\n \n      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\n      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:\n      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are\n      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\n      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be\n      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\n \n \nQ. What will happen to the earth at that time?\n \nA. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens\n   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-\n   more.\n \n      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in\n      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and\n      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and\n      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...\n      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new\n      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\n                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13\n \n \nQ. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will\n   come?\n \nA. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to\n   save.\n \n      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\n      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end\n      come.                                            Matthew 24:14\n \n \nQ. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?\n \nA. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing\n   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the\n   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not\n   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the\n   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be\n   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.\n \n      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden\n      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with\n      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3\n \n      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his\n      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7\n \n \nQ. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.\n \nA. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to\n   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.\n \n      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day\'s journey, and he\n      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be\n      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4\n \n \nQ. What did the people of Nineveh do?\n \nA. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented\n   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.\n \n      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry\n      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil\n      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can\n      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his\n      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9\n \n \nQ. Did God hear their prayers?\n \nA. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.\n \n \nQ. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-\n   ment?\n \nA. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has\n   become very short.\n \n      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\n      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed\n      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3\n \n      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,\n      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye\n      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for\n      us.

A  number  of  minor\nchanges  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing\nand  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph\nwhich  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the\ntext.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they\nappear here as indented paragraphs.\n \n \nI have read Mr. Camping\'s book, compared it with what the Bible actual-\nly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what\nthe  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that\nthere  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed\none  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these\nmatters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,\nit  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our\neternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more\nsenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with\nrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a\ncopy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself,\nyou may find the following information helpful:\n \n      title:       1994?\n      author:      Harold Camping\n      publisher:   Vantage Press\n      distributor: Baker and Taylor\n      ISBN:        0-533-10368-1\n \n \nI  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly\nagree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than\never  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts\n20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I\nam  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with\nanyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any\nreal  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little\ntime  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

The Assumption of our\nBlessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the\nredemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not\nASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along\nwith Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in\nHeaven.

I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you\nhow to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First\nuse the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions. \nNext, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions\nand specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken\nwill/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you\ndo is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be\nentered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will\nremind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have\nthree transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month,\nmiddle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.\n\nMike\n"

Maybe\n\nPC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance\nmanagement programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World,\nDecember 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.\nI can email you copies of these articles if you can\'t find them at your\nlibrary.\n\nI\'ve been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have\nseveral friends who use Quicken, though I\'ve not used it myself.  My\noverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager\nwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your\nfinances.\n\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:\n\n\tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:\n\tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile\n\tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.\n\n\tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that\n\tbudget.\n\n\tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill\n\tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.\n\t\n\tThe ability to print checks on your printer.\n\n\tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.\n\n\tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts\n\tup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically\n\tvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I\'m not sure about it.\n\n\tThe ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation\n\tprograms.\n\n\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that\nQuicken does not:\n\n\tA tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to\n\tpredict your tax liability for the coming year.  It\'s usefull to fine\n\ttune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn\'t get his due too early.\n\n\tAn insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep\n\trecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.\n\tIt can also compute your life expectancy.\n\n\tA financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, \n\teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to\n\tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and\n\tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you \n\tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford\n\ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good\n\tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether\n\ta particular investment\'s cash flow is adequate for your situation.\n\tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping\n\tyour kids with their tuition.  \n\n\tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets\n\tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this \n\tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules\n\tare automatically included here.\n\n\tA "desk" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file\n\tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital\n\tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a\n\trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment\n\tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to\n\ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list\n\tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.\n\nThere are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I\'m almost\nsure that Quicken doesn\'t do everything I\'ve listed.  If I\'m wrong, I\'m sure\nhordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.\n\nOne thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a \nWindows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version\nof Managing Your Money for release late this year.\n\nI hope this information is of use to you.  I\'ve found Managing Your Money to\nbe a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand\nI know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all\nthe features you need or want, I\'d go with it. If you find any of the Managing\nYour Money features that Quicken doesn\'t have to be useful, I think it\'s well\nworth the price.\n'

I can\'t\n: see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,\n\nre: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93\n\nThis article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2\nor DOS apps not running under Windows.\n\nOne of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that\ntheir RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost\neveryone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)\ndiscovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept\nan incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry\nerrors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or\nFAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer\nthan with the old 2400bps modem.\n\n\nThere are three reasons for the problem:\n\n1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most\n   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the\n   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high\n   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and\n   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded\n   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can\'t.\n\n2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and\n   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely\n   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you\n   are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a\n   16550". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance\n   about this issue,  you\'ll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the\n   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve\n   my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn\'t even\n   know what a UART was.\n\n3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2\'s do), or if you can upgrade\n   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience\n   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers\n   don\'t take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this\n   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications\n   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem\n   by themselves.\n\nIf you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of\nthe card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid\noverrunning it; however, I wouldn\'t want to bet that the card designers\nwere that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem\ncard.  Some modem cards don\'t even have conventional UARTs, but if they\nare to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.\nUse MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.\n\n\nThe Hardware Situation.\n\nThe UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250\nor Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can\'t replace\nthem).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft\ndiagnostic program \\WINDOWS\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*\nbringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from\naccurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.\n\nThe Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with\nconfigurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to\n460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there\'s no point in\npushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access\ncycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but\nit is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,\nsee National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.\n\nSo, what UART component do you have?\n\nTry to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM\nboard or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can\'t find a socketed component with\nthe numbers "8250" or "16450", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,\nand you won\'t be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE\nyour VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket\nCOM board.\n\nIf you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in\nNs16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several\nsuppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The "N" chip is the normal 40-pin\ndual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550\nchips without the "A" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).\n\nEarly Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those\nof their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various\nIC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states\nsupport for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:\nNational Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552\nChips&Technology:       82C607\nTexas Instruments:      t16c550a\nSilicon Systems:        73M550\nVLSI                    16C550\nTurboCom warns about the pre-"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,\nsays that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70\nsystems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).\n\nIf you DON\'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you\'ll need to buy an after-\nmarket COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you\nmay be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you\'ll need to\neither disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to\nCOM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).\n\nAlthough cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the\nproblem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology\nMCT-AIO+ card from:\n\nJDR Microdevices\n2233 Samaritan Drive\nSan Jose  CA  95124\n(800) 538-5000 voice US\n(408) 559-1200 voice other\n(800) 538-5005 FAX US\n\nThe MCT-AIO+ (and the "+" is important) sells for $89.95.

Each port can\nbe individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR,\nDCD, and DSR jumpers.\n\nJDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.\n\nI have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards\nwith 16550s:\n\nTSD Systems\n(407) 331-9130\n$19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.\n\nGreenfield Trading and Distributors\n(518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX).\nTheir card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.\n\nR&S DATA SYSTEMS, INC.\n820 East Highway 434\nLongwood, FL  32750\nPHONE: (407) 331-1424\nFAX: (407) 331-8606\n2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39\n\nI have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports,\nand am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based\n8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set\nthe internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.\n\n\nThe Software Situation\n\nSimply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun\nproblems.  The standard MS serial drivers don\'t take full advantage of the\n16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1\ndrivers have the following limitations:\n - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.\n - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt\n   rate of 10x during uploads.\n - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it\'s easy for 2\n   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).\n - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.\n   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1\n   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would\n   be effective.\n - The API won\'t accept rates above "CBR_128000".\n - The API won\'t let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even\n   if it did, DOS programs that aren\'t 16550-aware get little benefit\n   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.\n - They don\'t allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.\n - The BIOS doesn\'t initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.\n - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don\'t provide port\n   speed options above 19200 bps.\n\nThese problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may\nor may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).\nRumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "4.0".\n\nYou can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying\na copy of "TurboCom", current version 1.2, from:\n\nBio-Engineering Research\nPacific CommWare Division\n180 Beacon Hill Lane\nAshland  OR   97520-9701\n(503) 482-2744 voice\n(503) 482-2627 FAX\n(503) 482-2633 BBS\nMCImail:    344-5374\nCompuServe: 71521,760\n\nPrice was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit\ncards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom\nbut as far as I know, they don\'t stock it.  Bio is not a software company\nper se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for\nan in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a\nmarket for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They\nrecently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.\n\nI now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my\ndatacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely\nsee transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps\nwhen linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.\nUploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts\nare still using antique UARTs and drivers.\n\nNote that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu\nin Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets\naround this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will\nset the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the\nWindows APIs and dialog boxes.\n\nI also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you\ndo the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is\nnot a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)\nstandard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another\n16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving\nsystem or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough\nto let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm\nengineer has informed me that the 16550\'s can\'t really do CTS/RTS all\nby itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above\n115,200 may still be risky.\n\nEven with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still\nexperience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and\nserious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to\nbuy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a\n16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of\nTurboCom, can be found in the Feb\'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine.\nI suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with\nprocess priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose\nthrashing system still runs into comm problems.\n\n\nClosing Soapbox Comments\n\nThe state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across\nthe computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,\nthe job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be\nassigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer\ncompanies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years\nbehind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation\nvendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the\ninitial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was\nsubsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the\nexception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent\nI/O.\n\nYou may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this\nsituation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect\ncries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs "sort of"\nwork today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a\nhardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that\nuse that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.\n\nRegards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road\nBob Niland                                        Suite 503\nInternet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525\nCompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209\n\n                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

You can set up different config.sys\nand autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their\nmenu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini\nand system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows,\nit can copy back generic .ini files if you want.\n\nThis is the only way I can think of.

The problem is that\nonce the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added\nto the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We\nwould like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for\nfurther use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:\n\n (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize\nprecisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it\'s a compressed\nformat - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the\noffending header.\n\n (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF? It would be\nreally nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. ;)\n\n I\'ve already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which contain\ngraphics formats documentation, with no luck.

I\'d assume that the problem here is that an MD system\ncan have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn\'t pick up\nthe occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!\n\n--\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndavid shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625\n                inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq\n\t\t"They didn\'t like the rates, they don\'t like the poll tax,\n\t\t and they won\'t like the council tax."   - Nicholas Ridley   \n'

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\nescapes me at the moment) called "Homosexuals in History" asserts that Roehm\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\'s SA circle.\n\n>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,\n>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and\n>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. \n\nWell, you\'re the one who is in Germany. If you don\'t believe the history books,\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the "knight of the\nlong knives" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\'s\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\'ve \nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \n\n>(Irving, a\n>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance\n>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)\n\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\'t you think they \nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \n\n>I challenge anyone to document this claim.\n\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\n\n>I *have* found a great\n>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the\n>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,\n>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.\n\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\n\nI don\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\'s friends\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\'s homosexuality.\n\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality.\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\n\nNo, I don\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\'t have the time. Nothing is\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\n                                                                           \n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\nDavid Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)\n"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softly\nof us in days hereafter..."

How ere you disciplined as a kid\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\'s have never\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\'s law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that "what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me."  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\'ll admit I\'ve been tempted with\nat times.  When I\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\'s\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.\n-- \nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: "Mommys and Daddys & other\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, \'cause Heaven is just a great\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!"\n'

You might have to start asking the\nsame sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it\nwould not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the\nlast several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would\nbegin to look like the biased attack that it is.\n\n   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for\nPolicy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot\nwho hates Israel.\n\n   Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel?  I\nhave heard that your family once lived in Israel, but the members\nof your family could not cut the competition there.  Is this true\nabout your family?  Is this true about you?  Is this actually not\nabout Israel, but is really a personal vendetta?  Why are you not\nthe least bit objective about Israel?  Do you think that the name\nof your phony-baloney center hides your bias in the least?  Get a\nclue, Mr. Davidsson.  Haven't you realized yet that when you post\nsuch stupidity in this group, you are going to incur answers from\npeople who are armed with the truth?  Haven't you realized that a\npiece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a\ntruth?  Haven't you realized that you are in over your head?  The\npeople who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or\nneed them to be.  This is not the place for such pseudo-analysis.\nYou will be continually ripped to shreds, until you start to show\nsome regard for objectivity.  Or you can continue to show what an\nanti-Israel zealot you are, trying to disguise your bias behind a\npompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research.'  You ought to\nknow that you are a laughing stock, your 'Center' is considered a\njoke, and until you either go away, or make at least some attempt\nto be objective, you will have a place of honor among the clowns,\nbigots, and idiots of Usenet.\n"

Obviously, it\nis no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published\ndocuments to find material to use against Israel makes it so.  \n\n   Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising\nin itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was\ncurious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind\nhis phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some\ntypical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  Is\nhe some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it\nthere, and is now taking his failure out on Israel?  \n\n   Let's shed some light on this clown once and for all.  It will\nhelp put his nonsense in the proper perspective.  And the readers\nof this group who are more interested in fact than in anti-Israel\nhyperbola can ignore this junk.\n\n"

Thus it\nis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed\nfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political\nlessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.\n\n\nIn article <1993Apr14.121823.21851@oneb.almanac.bc.ca>, kmcvay@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (Ken Mcvay) writes:\n\n|>As Dawidowicz points out, in "The Holocaust and the Historians," (Harvard \n|>University Press, 34-38):\n|>\n|>"...the nadir in Hitlerology is reached by David Irving\'s "Hitler\'s\n|>War."<34> An amateur historian, whose reputation as a German apologist and\n|>as a writer without regard for accuracy or truth won him a measure of\n|>notoriety, <35> Irving produced a 926-page work intended to show that Hitler\n|>was kind to his animals and to his secretaries, that he was "probably the\n|>weakest _leader_ Germany has known in this century," and that he did not\n|>murder the Jews or even wish to do so, but that the murder was committed\n|>behind his back, without his knowledge or consent." \n\nLet us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\nsupporter?\n\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\nof their rhetoric. \n\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one "race"\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\n\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\nlatter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are made\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\n\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\nof a system that would commit genocide. \n\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\n\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\n\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\n\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \naffect the system.\n\n\nPhill Hallam-Baker\nPhill Hallam-Baker\n'

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

I am very pleased with \nthe results.  The catalog description is as follows:\n\n\tThe Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager \n\tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a\n\tprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two\n\tcounter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits --\n\treleasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.\n\n\tPressure Point Massager    A2623   $109\n\nTo order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or\nfax at 1-800-345-4021.\n\n********\nNOTE:\nWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price\nwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog\nenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  \nQUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,\nand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it\nlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the\nfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a\nreason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to\nship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could \nuse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old \none.  VERY reasonable people.\n********\n\nI have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I \nwould be described as "structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches \nand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  \nIf, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough\ntime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, \nmore prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require \nphysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit \nto get the prescription for p.t.  \n\nThe tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache\n(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my \nphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles \nin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the \nheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to \nwhile it is being massaged.\n\nI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing\nsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my \nneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in \nthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient \np.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up \nin the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.\n\nI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base\nunit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on each\nside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal "thumbs" are about \n1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base.  The thumbs \nare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more \ntoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in \neither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side \nof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either\nside.

The handles can also be used if sitting or\nstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are\nalso impaired (I\'m typing this over an extended period of time), and I \ndon\'t have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works \nwell for me.\n\nFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager\nbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or\nnot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  \nIf I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches \nwhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use \nthan the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \n(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and \nmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than \nnothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are \nnot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don\'t \npin it up first.  As far as I\'m concerned, the easier something like this \nis to use, the more likely I\'ll use/do it.  If there are multiple \nconsiderations/hassles, I\'m more likely to not bother with it.\n\nNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion \nfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my\nneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard\nagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a\nfew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  \nAfter that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, \nthe pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  \nI also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the \nmost vulnerable point for me.\n\nIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,\nalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at\na time) to really work it out.\n\nI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I\ncannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I\'ve had\nit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also \nto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have\nbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this \nwas very timely  for me.\n\nThis is the 1st product I\'ve ordered from this company and only recently\nbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been\nin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,\nwhile they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog\nproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought\nput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones\nI\'ve seen such as "Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog" or "Mature Wisdom".\nI\'m only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no\nbig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, \nparticularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.\n\nI apologize for the length of this, but it\'s the kind of info _I_ would \nlike to know before ordering something thru the mail.\n\n\nRobin Coutellier                   \nNorthern Telecom, Mountain View, CA\nINTERNET: robin@ntmtv.com\nUUCP:portal!ntmtv!robin\n\n\n\n'

Same circumstance, same onset symptoms, \nsame cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the people\nI know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such\na wide variation between people with respect to what causes their\nheadaches, that I generally don\'t bother sharing what I\'ve learned\nabout mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.\n\nI don\'t think it\'s heat, per se (I\'ve had more in winter than summer).\nDehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before\nplaying rather than after.\n\nBeing in shape doesn\'t seem to help me much, either.\n\nI\'ve identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in \ndescending order of importance):\n\n1) Heavy exercise\n2) Sleep deprivation\n3) Fasting\t\t(e.g., skipped breakfast)\n4) Physical trauma\t(e.g., head bonk)\n\nHeavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I \ndon\'t get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of \nthe other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered \nthis, I\'ve been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two \nor three years when I get cocky ("It\'s been so long, maybe I just don\'t \nget them anymore") and stop being careful.\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\nJohn.\n'

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Yes, I understand the issues.  I don\'t even\nparticularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the\nsort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must\nfind things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.\n\nA few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:\n\n\t1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n'
OldPos 7 | 13 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

I got the vague impression from their mission proposal\nthat they weren\'t taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They\nseemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without \nexplaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application\nI remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  That\'s\ngreat, but they don\'t explain why it can\'t be done robotically. \n\n>> Hrumph.

We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - "you\'ve lost it!"  The "me" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened\nto your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn\nV\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!\n\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\nAmerican.  Let\'s go fly it!\n'

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]\n\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\'s idea -- Any Takers?\n'
