The\nhardware is "truecolor" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit\nstatic color visual.

The three problems I see are:\n\n  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.\n  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.\n  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the\n     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.\n\nBeing more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these\nlimitations thwart many X clients?

Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\n\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\n10-9 in the first period.\n\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\n\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\n\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\ndeflected the puck in the net.\n\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\n\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\n\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\nangle.\n\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\n\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\nin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on\non four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in\nthe league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.\n \nThe game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an\nAll-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when\nCBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday\nin St. Louis.\n\nBox score\n---------\nBlues 4, Blackhawks 3\n\nBLUES       0    2    2   --   4\nCHICAGO     1    2    0   --   3\n\nFIRST PERIOD\n\n   CHI -- Noonan 1 (Larmer, K.Brown), 8:17.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (holding), 2:28; Zombo, StL (interference), 6:00;\nMurphy, Chi (high-sticking), 11:30; Grimson, Chi (boarding), 14:39; Zombo, StL\n(holding), 18:46.\n\nSECOND PERIOD\n\n   STL -- Brown 1 (Shanahan, Emerson), 3:12.\n   CHI -- (PPG) Noonan 2 (Roenick, Chelios), 5:40.\n   CHI -- Noonan 3 (Matteau, Sutter), 8:51.\n   STL -- Felsner 1 (McRae, Janney), 12:49.\n\n   Penalties -- Baron, StL (interference), 4:33; Wilson, StL (tripping), 9:31.\n\nTHIRD PERIOD\n\n   STL -- (PPG) Shanahan 1 (J.Brown, Hull), 11:12.\n   STL -- (PPG) Hull 1 (Emerson, J.Brown), 11:29.\n\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (roughing), 1:54; Matteau, Chi (high-sticking),\n9:56; Smith, Chi (slashing), 10:49; Baron, StL (roughing), 14:23.\n\nSHOTS ON GOAL\n\nBLUES       10    10     7   --   27\nCHICAGO      9     5    13   --   27\n\nPower-play Opportunities -- St. Louis 2 of 4; Chicago 1 of 7.\n\nGoaltenders -- St. Louis, Joseph, 1-0-0 (27 shots-24 saves).\n               Chicago, Belfour, 0-1-0 (27-23).\n\nReferee -- Kerry Fraser.

Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I\'m glad I didn\'t see it go in at the end," Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\'s anger.\n\n``It wasn\'t pretty at the end," he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\'t have, but\nit did."\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\'s end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It\'s a shame we let down," said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\'d have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy."\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that\'s all that matters," said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play."\n\nSome players didn\'t have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\'t quit," said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan\'t allow five goals like we did, that\'s not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on."\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\'s loss.\n\n``I didn\'t know it was final," he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\'re in the playoffs,\nand that\'s great, but it\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend."\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn\'t want to see the score, I didn\'t want to know the score,"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\'s the approach we took."\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver," Bassen said. ``He\'s in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he\'s happy."\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\'s shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\'s second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there," Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in."\n\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \n  %   \\ \\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \n  *    \\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \n  %     \\    ________/                                                   *\n  *      \\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \n  %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *\n  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*% \n'

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your\ncalculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is\n307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I\ndon't think it is a BIOS mode.  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do\nthat either.  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and\n640x480.  That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA.\n"

Is this true?\n\nI own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \n  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\n\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with\n  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly\n  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\n\nMy last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like\n  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded\n  like new.\n\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\n\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.\n\n--\n***********************************************************************\n**    Alan Webber                                                    **\n**                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          **\n**                                                                   **\n** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **\n** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **\n** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **\n** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    **\n***********************************************************************\n"

He must have been abused by a man and is\n] living his life in an attempt to vilify all men who like sex with other men\n] something slightly similar to the way his assailant liked it with him. He\n] will alter or misrepresent anything he finds to try to prove that there are\n] homosexuals who wish to rape little boys like he was coming out of the\n] woodwork. There is no hope for him. In all probability he is secretly gay,\n] which compounds his neurosis in his own mind, by thinking that someone else\n] made him that way. I don\'t personally see how someone like him could walk\n] and chew gum at the same time, as mentally crippled and dominated as he is\n] by his fantasies.\n] \n] He would have you believe that the figures on the percentage of people who\n] like to do it with the same sex sometime or all the time is way smaller\n] than it is, but then he will virtually assert that everyone\'s queer and\n] they\'re trying to get him. He actually believes, despite all evidence that\n] homosexuals do some huge disproportionate amount of child sexual abuse,\n] even though he insists that there may be as few as 1% of them in the male\n] population! If there were that few of them in the population, San Francisco\n] would currently be empty, because a significant portion of them have sought\n] a tolerant atmosphere in that city, and the numbers simply do not work when\n] you add up their home town origins.

There are situations\nin which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex\n(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least\nsome sense). These same situations don\'t (necessarily) protect the\nchildren from abuse by members of the *same* sex.\n\nIf we can understand that, it\'s not such a tremendous leap to suggest\nthat if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a\npractical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations\nin which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse\nthem. By working together "with good will on both sides", we may be\nable to start solving problems without restricting anyone\'s freedoms.\n\nMr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit\'s post as an excuse for\npersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn\'t (by a *long*\nstretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish\nand it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the\nfuture.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nRick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QED\nDisclaimer: My employer\'s views are orthogonal to these.\nThe early bird got worms.\n'

Normally, the older boards have\na 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char\nthey received.

But if you are\nrunning a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the\ncpu cannot work the whole time with one task. \n\nThe result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.\n\n> 4) Is it only for internal modems?\n\nNO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board,\nwhereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port\nwhich has the UART on board.\n\n> If you have any experience with 9600 or higher speed modems, please\n> let me know what you think.

Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\n   of idiocy is that if you\'re going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\n   you\'d better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\n\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\n   outgunned, they didn\'t expect such heavy resistance.  When\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\n   you could!\n\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I\'m\n   more than ever convinced that\'s right on target.  An anecdote not\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There\'s\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\n   was told this by a relative of my wife\'s who happens to be an FBI\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let\'s just say\n   uncomplimentary.\n\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\n   the BD\'s had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we\'re *still* hearing\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\n   the "He\'s a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!"\n   flag.  Sigh.\n\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I\'d expect the\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\n   BD\'s feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it\n   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh\'s\n   paranoid delusions.\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n#include <std_disclaimer.h>\n\nDan S.\n'

"He was\nsupposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn\'t obey his\nown rules."\n\tThe documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped\nwould be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after\nWorld War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.\n\tHimmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than\n100 German secret police generals.  "I also want to talk to you,\nquite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be\nmentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.\nI mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish\nrace.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been\nwritten and is never to be written."  [Emphasis mine--rje]\n\tThe German word Himmler uses that is translated as\n"extermination" is *Ausrottung*.\n\tWolfe said a more precise translation would be "extirpation"\nor "tearing up by the roots."\n\tIn his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,\n"Judenevakuierung" or "evacuation of the Jews."  But archives\nofficials said "extermination" is the word he actually\nspoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.\n\tHimmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler\'s "final solution of the\nJewish question," committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.\n\tThe National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is\na preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum here on April 26.\n\tThe National Archives exhibit includes a page each of\nHimmler\'s handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and\nan offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.\n\n\t---From p.A10 of Saturday\'s L.A.

Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\nterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\nArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\nvery lives.\n\tI mention this not because I\'m anti semitic [I\'m part\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\nIsraelites pisses me off so.

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn\'t be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\'ll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\'d bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn\'t give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I\'ll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as \n      the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun\n'

The article starts with "A leader\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\nbe impossible." O\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\nmeaningful research "is a real question for me."\nO\'Connor said "everything is fair game," including\n"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\nmanned space shuttle fleet."\n\nO\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\ninto three categories based on cost.\n\nThe Post says O\'Connor described the design derived\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\nlistened in on part of O\'Connor\'s briefing to the press\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\'Connor\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\nCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\'Connor say\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\nthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).\n\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\nas "one features modules that could gradually be fitted\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option\nwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -\nthe fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."\n\nThe last sentence in the article contradicts the title\n& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He\n[O\'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned\nspace station Freedom is still possible within the\nadministration\'s budget guidelines."\n\n'

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,\nyou need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.

9 b'From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)\nSubject: RIMSAT, US/Russian joint venture\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\nLines: 121\n\n\nI\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\'ve \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\n\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\nslots.\n\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\nsupporting Tonga\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \nthe Pacific Rim. \n\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\'t think I\'ll visit there for a long time.\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\nthat people operate.  For example "everybody can sell you everything."  \nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\n\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\n\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \nSiberia (can\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\n\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \nspecifications, they\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\nnow.\n\nTidbits:\n\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\nthat "we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier."\n\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\nwithin 9 months.\n\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\n\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\npartly because we aren\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government "every two weeks" but we don\'t worry \nbecause we\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\nreally goes on in Russia we won\'t worry about their stability as much.\n\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the "equivalent" value in \nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\n\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\n\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\nhardware.\n\n-- \nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t    "Find a way or make one."\n\t             -attributed to Hannibal\n'

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which\n    much of the net community has settled. Please DON\'T bring them up again\n    unless there\'s something truly new to be discussed. The net can\'t set\n    public policy, that\'s what your representatives are for.\n\n\n    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS\n\n    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints\n    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\n    microfilm.\n\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\'s vintage hardware (like\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\n    from.\n\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\n    sheet design.\n\n\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\n\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\n    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently\n    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early\n    in a mission.\n\n\n    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES\n\n    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to\n    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium\n    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\n\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\n    pursue are:\n\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\n    Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\n    Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good\n    article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo\'s launch,\n    "Showdown at Pad 39-B," by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November\n    1989 issue of *Ad Astra*.

Studies\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\n    study, Charles Jackman.\n\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\n\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\n\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Shuttle sources:\t  725,000 kilograms/year\n\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\n\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\n\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\n    do at the present time.\n\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\n    Shuttle\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\n\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\n    you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\n\n    References:\n\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\n\n\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\n\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\n    team\'s medical/forensic report.\n\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\n\n\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\n\n    You can\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\n    because it can\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\n    specialized for travel between Earth\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\n    spacecraft.\n\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\n\n\n    THE "FACE ON MARS"\n\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\n\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\'t\n    know the address) to study the Face.\n\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\n    sci.astro.\n\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

I can hop the\nshuttle to NY for $90 bucks,  now that\'s golden.\n\nMercury gemini, and apollo were romantic,  but let\'s be honest.\nPeeing in bags,  having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime\nyou needed a bowel movement.  Living for days inside a VW Bug.\nRomantic,  but not commercial.   The DC-X  points out a most likely\nnew golden age.  An age where  fat cigar smoking business men in\nloud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls\nand used space ship lots.\n\nhhhmmmmm,  maybe i\'ll  retract that golden age bit.   Maybe it was\nbetter in the old days.  Of course, then we\'ll have  wally schirra\ntelling his great grand children, "In my day,  we walked on the moon.\nEvery day.

20 b'From: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)\nSubject: Space FAQ 10/15 - Planetary Probe History\nSupersedes: <probe_730956556@cs.unc.edu>\nOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\nLines: 527\nDistribution: world\nExpires: 6 May 1993 19:59:36 GMT\nNNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.edu\nKeywords: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nArchive-name: space/probe\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $\n\nPLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS\n\n    This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes\n    (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\n\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\n    from the expression "R-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\n\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\n\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\'s energy for power from its solar\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the\n    geological and biological sense.\n\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\n    that Venus\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\n    that of Earth\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\n    of an ocean.\n\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\n    the concept of Mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\n    launcher autopilot failed.\n\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\n    images of Mars\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\n\n\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\n\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\n\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\n    to do so.\n\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\n    the first radar studies of the planet\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\n    its batteries failed.\n\n\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\n\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\n\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\n\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\n\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\n\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\n\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\n\n\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\n\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\n\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\n\n\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\n\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\' sky was\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\n\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\n    engineers\' efforts through May of 1983.\n\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\'s lander has been designated the\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\n\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\n    down on April 12, 1980.\n\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\n\n\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\n\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\n\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\n    is known). Titan\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\' appearance was\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\n\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\n\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\n    discovered. Neptune\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\'s liquid at 38K?)\n\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\n    location of the heliopause.\n\n\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\n\n\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\n\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\n\t     craft in solar orbit.\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\n\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\n\t     from surface.\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8\n\t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were\n\t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.\n    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil\n\t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\n\t      1972.\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\'s\n\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\n\t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\n\t      1976.\n\n\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\n\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\n\t       lost enroute in 1961.\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\n\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\n\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\n\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\n\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\n\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\n\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\n\t       similar in 1969.\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\n\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\n\t       1972.\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\n\t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar\n\t       mission.\n    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.\n\t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.\n    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of\n\t\tplanet\'s surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.\n    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian\n\t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on\n\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\n\t     March of 1986.\n\n\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\n\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\n\t     enroute the following year.\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\n\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\n\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\n\t     Planet in 1971.\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\n\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\n\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\n\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\n\t     probe MARINER 9.\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\n\t     with its flyby bus.\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\' largest\n\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\n\t       human/computer error.\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\n\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\n\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\n\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\n    space program remains to be seen.\n\n\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\'s Comet within about 7 million km\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\'s. The closest\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\n\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\'s radius)), and the third\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\n\n\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\n\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\n    19, but the spacecraft\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\n\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\'s atmosphere. Hiten\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\n    approach:\n\n\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\n\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\n\tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\n\tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days\n\n\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\n\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\n    public and university library.

I recommend these works after you first study\n    some of the books listed above.\n\n    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL\n    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth\'s\n    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,\n    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER\n    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the\n    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions\n    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and\n    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\n    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\n    probably know.\n\n    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\n    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their\n    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe\n    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,\n    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.\n\n    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I\n    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas\n    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from\n    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.\n\n    Larry Klaes  klaes@verga.enet.dec.com\n\nNEXT: FAQ #11/15 - Upcoming planetary probes - missions and schedules\n'

Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I\'m\n    guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either\n    event, how is the data framed?\n2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I\'m guessing half-duplex\n    since the host can turn LEDs on and off.\n3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "AT\n    keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?\n\nIf anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of\ninformation) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com.\nWhatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in\nthe event of a booboo.\n\nThank you for your time.\nDanke fuer Ihre Zeit.\n\nThomas Gamet (gamet@erg.sri.com)\nSoftware Engineer\nSRI International\n'

The seller insisted\nthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it\nis bad. Is this reasonable?\n\nBasically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of \nthe thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.\n\nI would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my\ne-mail address.\n\nI know there is such a risk that you could lose money.

I won the battle but \nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet\'s \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \na "use deduction" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \nfor my insurance.\n\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \nthat required attention included the transmission, \nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\n\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\n\n'
OldPos 113 | 9 b'From: f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\nSubject: Disappointed by La Cie\nOrganization: Univ of Miami IR\nLines: 52\n\nApproximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for\n$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\'ve called La Cie again and they\'ve given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\'t see\nthe drive there\'s a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\'ll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\'t mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\na letter to La Cie\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\'t even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat\'s the moral of this story? I\'m not sure. But I do know I won\'t buy any\nother products from La Cie in the future.\n\nBill Krauthammer\nf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\n\nPS Please don\'t email or post about how good your La Cie product and service\nhas been. I\'m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like\nthat. All I\'m saying is that I\'ve had a disappointing experience with them and\nI\'ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.\n\n'

I\'m sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting\nspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"\nposts.  Not that I think we shouldn\'t hear about the bad deals, but it would be\nnice to hear some good news once in a while.\n\nAfter seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a\nrequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50\nin his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded\nmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. \nImagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a\nmessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed\nthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and\nassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He\nsent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a\ntransfer of license.  This wasn\'t good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him\nto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times\nto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for\nmy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the\ndeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world\'s\nbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good\nones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat\nyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my\nsoftware from him.\n\nBravo, Mr. Miller!\n\n- Kevin Harter\n'

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in\na powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was\ntold by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return\nthe original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for\nreturning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.\n\nWell, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were\never returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me "Why we never\nreceived your old chips."  I then explained I the procedure that I had\nfollowed to return them, to which the person replied "You mean you sent them\nUS Mail?" (which I had, per the original sales person\'s instructions.)  I was\ntold that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that\nI should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly\nwhat I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were\nabsolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted\nto trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to\nTechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn\'t give-up because I was so disgusted.)\nSales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them\nto "make it right."\n\nI finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking\nthem to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously\nappeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with\nthe service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of\nknowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths\nto prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c\'est la vie.  I will never\nbuy another product from them again.\n\n(There - had to get that off my chest!)\n'

The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won\'t pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it\'s illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can\'t have tint, if\nyou can\'t see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said "It\'s just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now." Well, won\'t argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it\'s OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I\'d like to keep it (I\'ll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I\'d also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it\'s OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won\'t\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn\'t mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\n\nAny comments about it will be welcome!\n\nMichal\n\n'

My\ncomment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors\nthat supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.\n\nWhat I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that\nwe *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the\nCrimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.\n\nI\'m also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a\nprevious site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around\nfor a while, rather than being flushed.\n\nNow I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\nkeep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\npressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\njust before the end of the quarter), but I\'m just a little tired of\ngetting boned in the process.\n\nMaybe it\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\naren\'t entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,\nfor instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs\nand organizations, doesn\'t have a load of money to spend on computers\nevery year, so we can\'t be out buying new systems on a regular basis.\nThe boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the\nentire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That\nmeans that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I\nhave the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one\nprevious poster\'s words, \'to fill a niche\' to compete with some other\nvendor.  I\'m going to be looking at this box for the next five years.\nAnd every time I look at it, I\'m going to think about SGI and how I\ncould have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we\'re\nsupported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).\n\nNow you\'ll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a\ncorner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspl\n-- \nSteve Lamont, SciViGuy -- (619) 534-7968 -- spl@szechuan.ucsd.edu\nSan Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla, CA 92093-0608\n"My other car is a car, too."\n                 - Bumper strip seen on I-805\n'

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don\'t want to have to separate someone\'s bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\n----------------------------------------------------\n      |                            | Exit\n      |                            | 130B\n      |                            |\n   \n'

Compression was\na little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  They\nsaid that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low \nnumbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike looked\ngreat.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! \nIt is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  \nI am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those \nwho posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  \n( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I should\nbe road legal tomorrow.  I am ignoring the afforementioned concerns about \nthe transmission and taking my chances.\n\nBeing a reletively new reader, I am quite impressed with all the usefull\ninfo available on this newsgroup.

There\nis no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer\nwas mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.\nSo it led a "sheltered" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside\nthe hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole\ndrilled into your hull.\n\n\tIt is fully waterproof and fits into a 2" hole in a bulkhead\n(that\'s where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a\npowerboat. It reads depth to 199\' and has a backlit LCD display. It has\nan adjustable shallow water alarm built in. \n\n\tI am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that\noutputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine\nand is very stable.\n\n\n\tIt is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.\n\n\n\tThe first 80$ takes it, or best offer. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tJohn R.

But the demonstration of this\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\n\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\n\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\ntorque. \n\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\n\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\nbottle is $25.\n\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\nbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against\nmy common sense.\n\nHas anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?\nIf you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the \nsecond floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.\n\nJason Chen\n\n"

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\nalternative health therapies.]\n\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to \'illuminate\'\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\n  were subject to changes.  The object\'s life activity was also visible in\n  highly variable colour patterns.\n\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\n\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people\'s\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\n  isn\'t actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\n\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can \'see\'\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\n  can\'t possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\n  the actual object itself.\n\n  [...]\n\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally \'charged\' by a healer\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\n\n\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, "Reality shopping; a\nconsumer\'s guide to new age hokum.", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\nvNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for\nevaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author\'s favorite examples\nof hokum.]\n\n  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of\n  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian\n  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.\n  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,\n  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous\n  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of\n  the unknown.\n\n-- \nPeter Kaminski\nkaminski@netcom.com\n'

It further at least implicitly advances the position that\nsciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the\ncontext in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\nand even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\nweeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this critical\nfunction should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\nIf experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\nsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\nof the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.\nThis is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)\n\nTrue, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is\n*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\nresulted in some way from a dream or from one\'s political views simply\ndo not generalize well to the actual history of science.\n-- \nGary H.

The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan\'s\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\nour boy\'s model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\nprobably see even less cooling.

Does this mean that God no longer\nspeaks?  I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but\nclearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have\nnever heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the\nLord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are\nmature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow\nbelievers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging\nprophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed\n-- but God is not silent!\n\n>Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new\n>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call\n>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn\'t that be more having to do with\n>knowledge?

The question is not how to label it, but\nhow to receive it.

Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,\nbecause I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.\n\tBasically, there are a number of functions with prototypes\nset up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite\nwidget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :\n\n\ttypedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)\n\nbut in several places in the HP source code, they reference the\ninsert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just\none, as the prototype suggests.  For example:\n\n\t(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)\n\nNow, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments\nare passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to\nhow to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the\ncode to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,\nor has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.\n\tMany thanks in advance for any help.\n\n--\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\nBill Woodward        | wpwood@austin.ibm.com   <-- Try this first\nAIX Software Support | billw@aixwiz.austin.ibm.com  \nGraphics Group       | 512-838-2834\nI am the terror that flaps in the night.\n"

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

I am more used to\nthe dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean\nand reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike\nis part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do\nI remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without\nscrewing it down before reading?\n\nThe service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on\nthe head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do\nyou know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?\n\nMy headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter\nreplacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?\n\nAs always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia\nhas finally turned WARM.

The question is how much that quality\nis worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service\n\n>This radio can hear a repeater thats 40 miles away without\n> an antenna.\n\nOk, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is\n"good enough", and how much is someone willing to pay for it?\nA good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial\nquality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and\nperformance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*?\nOnly the individual involved can answer that question, and each\nham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth\n4 times the price to you, then more power to ya\'. But I\'m amazed\nthat folks make that choice. For, me, given that I\'ve got $2000 to\nspend, I\'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over\na Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality\ngear is "good enough".

(Sorry for length).\n\nTo increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed\nfrom 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.\nThis is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some\naluminum foil down to work on.\n\t1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.\n\t2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,\n\t\tspreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.\n\t3. Remove the flopy drive.\n\t4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting\n\t\tthe supply straight up and out.\n\t5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom\n\t\tside of the fan and lifting straight up and out.\n\t6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and\n\t\tright side of the board and sliding the board forward then\n\t\tlifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the\n\t\tboard must be removed first)\n\t7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).\n\t\tThis is not easy even for a skilled solderer.\n\t8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins\n\t\tby pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.\n\t9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder \n\t\tthem in.\n\t10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.\n\t11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and \n\t\tthe other large chip just to the right of the processor and\n\t\tfigure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a\n\t\tsimple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole\n\t\tin the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using\n\t\tinsulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat\n\t\tsync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.\n\n\t12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.\n\nDisclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.\n\t    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will\n\t    void your warentee.\n\nBye for now,\n************************************************\nRalph Durtschi    (208) 236-3256\nIdaho State University\nEMAIL:  durtralp@ux1.isu.edu\n************************************************ \n\n"

So isn\'t that saving money?\n\t\n\tYes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may\nwell be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but \nsince a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well\nworth it to buy the Saturn.\n\n>Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, \n>then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was\n>already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they\n>reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:\n\n>1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.\n> \n>2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.\n\n>Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even \n>the buyers for other cars will pay less.\n\n\n\tNot necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don\'t \nmake a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally\ndo, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn\'t give up\nthe profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-\ncar profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.\n\n>Isn\'t that saving money?\n\n\tMaybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.

The attempts to quiet any violence\n    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder\n    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and\n    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\n\n\n>The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population\n>density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.\n>The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\n>Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\n>strip and seek work in Israel.\n\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\n    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to\n    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\n    racist ommission on your part.\n\n\n>While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\n>Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\n>the Gazan resistance.

A population denied basic human rights is entitled to\n>rise up against its tormentors.\n\n    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is\n    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have\n    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave\n    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the\n    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing\n    but an anti-Israel charade.\n\n\n>As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of\n>Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are\n>considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops\n>and fields. \n\n    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli\n    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials\n    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your\n    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan\n    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as\n    collaborators.\n\n\n\t     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in\n>Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for\n>the Master Race.\n\n    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you\n    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of\n    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the\n    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have   \n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \n    \n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \n    race,' for you to avoid...\n\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\n    in Lebanon.  \n\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\n\n\n>The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the\n>right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the\n>occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some\n>Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over\n>Gaza through Arab collaborators.\n\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\n    manner.\n\n\n>As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible\n>with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming\n>Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for\n>self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish\n>society does not consider Gazans full human beings. \n\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is\n    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had\n    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land\n    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS\n    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a \n    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do\n    continuously refer to international law, would you please say\n    what specific international laws Israel is violating?  \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   This attitude\n>is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. \n\n    I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.\n\n\n>                                                             The\n>current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are\n>consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister\n>Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. \n\n    Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he\n    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll\n    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort\n    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.\n\n\n>                                           One is led to ask\n>oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister\n>goals towards the Gazans ?

Do you have an\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \n\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe\n    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born\n    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is\n    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \n    appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other \n    people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do \n    some good.\n \n    But for now, you are a fruad.\n\n\n \n"

Look up "shielding" in your dictionary.  You\n>don\'t need six feet of lead to make decent shielding; your dead skin\n>cell layer does an excellent job on alpha particles, and neutrons\n>are slowed by mere *water*.  What do you think 75% of you is?\n\nBut whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the\nneutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water\nturning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would \nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\n\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\nis clearly appropriate.\n\n>>  Plus these things have no self-\n>>defense purposes.  It\'s kinda hard to justify their use as\n>>a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use\n>>(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration\n>>(translation:  cities and population centers).\n\n>\tIf the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal\n>government, they are indeed useful weapons to the militia.\n\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\ndidn\'t overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \nexample) that didn\'t defend themselves were still under that same\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren\'t suited\nfor that.\n\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn\'t clear if it covers\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia\'s firepower would\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia\'s\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\na roughly equal share of the militia\'s firepower: His personal\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad\'s heavier firepower.\n\n                                                  Frank Crary\n                                                  CU Boulder\n\n'

Or do you think that the US\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\nEither the smart bombs didn\'t hit their targets (and we know they did),\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\ndestroying Iraq\'s military potential.

If some back-water country took over some other\nback-water country, we probably wouldn\'t intervene.  Not that we don\'t\ncare, but we can\'t be the world\'s policman.

In retrospect, I can see how the\nsightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  I originally saw\nit just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others\nmight see it differently.  I still think that Ken came on a bit\nstrong though.  I also think that your advice to Masud Khan:\n\n  #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee, it's a good idea to\n  #do a little homework, or at least think.\n\nwas unnecessary.\n\n>That's right.

If I agreed with that, then maybe your speech\non why this is bad might have been relevant.  But I think you're\nreading a lot into one flip sentence.

What exactly did I claim?\n     --------------------------------------------------\n    "I\'ve heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\n  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively."\n     --------------------------------------------------\n  \n    I wasn\'t wrong . . . I\'ve heard those descriptions.  If you\'re\n  paying attention, I\'ve mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\n  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n  "bullshit filters".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n  \nLater in the same post:\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\n"inclined" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\n\nPreviously Awesley had written:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\nPrompting me to write:\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\'t you, since\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nTo which Awesley replied:\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you\'re losing it so you\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\n  need some help, let me know and I\'l take your side of this for a\n  while.  You\'re not scoring here, you\'re boring here.\n\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\nthat too is ludicrous.\n\nI wrote:\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n  it. \n\nAwesley relied:\n     Glad to know you\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was "several".  I\'ve also\n  heard some things about that but I won\'t dare repeat them.  You\'d\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\n\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \nArmy tanks don\'t fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960\'s\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\n"this has gone far enough."  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\ndo not.\n\nI wrote:\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\nAwesley wrote:\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said "yes, I\nshelled Americans," or "I gave the orders to fire the cannons," or "I\nhelped cover it up"?\n\nI wrote:\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\nprefer\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\nAwesley replied:\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\'m quite willing to believe\n  that they did fire their guns.\n\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn\'t it known?\n\nAwesley concludes:\n     Now then, we\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\n  this far and all you\'ve managed to say is that you don\'t believe the\n  account I cited.\n\nActually, now we have established that I don\'t believe what you believe, as\nwell as why I don\'t believe it.  And if it\'s boring, then I yield the last\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.\n\n--John L. Scott\n'

Dr. Teperman \ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.

This time we not only scored \nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \nher for an entertaining evening.\n\n\n\nANNUAL MEETING\n\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \nslate for the Board.\n\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\n\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\n\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\n\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \nmembers and there is plenty of work. \n\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\n\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\n\nFUTURE MEETINGS\n\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \n\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\n\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \n\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\n\nNOTDAW\n\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \nAwareness Week.

Our  \nthree year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  \nthat appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.\n\n\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\n\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \nlifetime.  \n\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\n\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \nFoundation's mission is to change that. \n\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  \nFoundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  \nPrinceton, or sent directly to:\n\n\t\t\tThe Recurrent Respiratory Foundation\n\t                50 Wesleyan Drive\n\t                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690.\nThanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu\n"

The problem (in Type 1) is\n attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the\n enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.\n This will eventually cause death.\n\nEnyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and\n approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients\n administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable\n improvement in their condition.

He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston\nand has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.\nThis has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in\nlearning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with\nhospitals, procedures...etc.\n\nI don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed \nquite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight\nas a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs\nand that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal,\nbut the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests,\nbody structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not\nknow quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot\nof evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ).

It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia\nwas repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a\n"plug and patch".\n\nThe doctor considered the procedure a success.\n\nA few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that\nhe could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.\n\nNow the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn\'t identify any\nspecific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure\nnow says that yes there is a "new" hernia in the same area and he\nsaid that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.\n\nMy question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method to\ndetermine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from\nsomething else?\n\nSteve Heffner\n'

Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.\n6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes\nabates or goes away after a few months.\n7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.\n8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.\n9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on\nsomething else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.\n10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.\n11.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced\na seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog\'s Frosted\nFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\nfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision\nwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.\n\nWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had\na bowl of another Kellog\'s frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am\nembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once\nin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is the\nsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Ten \nminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure\nto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.\n\nWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for\nthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now\nafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\nhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I\nunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.\n\nOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good\nto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any\nexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical\ncommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and\nfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can\nguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas\nanyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get\nacross what is going on here.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--\nSharon Paulson                      s.s.paulson@larc.nasa.gov\nNASA Langley Research Center\nBldg. 1192D, Mailstop 156           Work: (804) 864-2241\nHampton, Virginia.  23681           Home: (804) 596-2362\n'

After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\n\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \n\n My questions are: \n\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\n     levels of pain?\n\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\n\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\n\n\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\n  \n  \n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\n\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.\n   \n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nGregory W.

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."

(Delta Clipper\nmight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less\nambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing\nsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting\nmoney in a big way.\n\nGiven this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a\nminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which\ndominates the cost of the project.\n-- \nAll work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"

Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn\'t be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\'ll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\'d bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn\'t give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\'d\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.

But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars\nin hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop\nyour own launch system, charging its entire development cost against\nyour contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No\nother demand is necessary.\n\n>> Any plan for doing\n>> sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting\n>> money in a big way.\n>\n>This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.

But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on\nexactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project\nstart to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,\nthe target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want\nspeed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in\nservice as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less\nthan 18 months after the development go-ahead.\n\nOne of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief\nthat you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending\nbillions of dollars.

One\n/thing you absolutely must do in such an engine is to guarantee that\n/the propellants ignite as soon as they mix, within milliseconds.  To\n/do otherwise is to fill your engine with a high explosive mixture\n/which, when it finally does ignite, blows everything to hell.\n\nDefinitely! In one of the reports of an early test conducted by Rocketdyne at \ntheir Santa Susanna Field Lab ("the Hill" above the San Fernando and Simi \nValleys), the result of a hung start was described as "structural failure" of \nthe combustion chamber.  The inspection picture showed pumps with nothing below\n, the CC had vaporized!  This was described in a class I took as a "typical\nengineering understatement" :-)\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions stated are solely my own (unless I change my mind).\nBen Muniz     MUNIZB%RWTMS2.decnet@consrt.rockwell.com    w(818)586-3578\nSpace Station Freedom:Rocketdyne/Rockwell:Structural Loads and Dynamics\n   "Man will not fly for fifty years": Wilbur to Orville Wright, 1901\n\n'
