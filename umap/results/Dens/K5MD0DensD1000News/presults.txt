I don\'t argue\nthat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I\njust question whether you >should<.\n\nThe fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we\ncan\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I\nreally hope I do, but I\'m not holding my self-similar breath.\n\n> There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal\n> image compression.\n\nUh huh.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  I\'ve been chasing fractal\ncompression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so\ngreat, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t,\nI\'ll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first\n\tencoding devices in the summer, he says.

Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic\n>phil. of sci. texts as an example of the inventive component of\n>hypothesizing. \n\nAnd has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-\nBernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

I would offer some rather well known examples\nsuch as Toricelli\'s Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air"\nhypothesis.

Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)\nout of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and\nwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.\nThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty\nat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, one\ncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new\ndomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you\nlike.\n-- \nGary H.

However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

The Bible "ends"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God\'s reign end there ?

This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.

However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.

The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

2 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

In other\nwords, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,\nnavigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. \nYou wouldn\'t want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I\'d hate to see\nfolks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch\nsystem comes on line.\n\nI guess I\'d simplify this to say that \'waste\' is a slippery concept.  If\nyour goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its\nnot \'wasted\' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500\nmillion, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.\n\nCraig\n\n\nCraig Keithley           |"I don\'t remember, I don\'t recall, \nApple Computer, Inc.     |I got no memory of anything at all"\nkeithley@apple.com       |Peter Gabriel, Third Album (1980)\n'

17 b"From: szabo@techbook.com (Nick Szabo)\nSubject: SSF Redesign: Constellation\nSummary: decentralize & automate functions\nKeywords: space station, constellation\nArticle-I.D.: techbook.C51z6E.CL1\nOrganization: TECHbooks --- Public Access UNIX --- (503) 220-0636\nLines: 89\n\nSSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

I was just wondering if we could have some kind\n>of update on DC-X.\n\nWell it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting\nready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out\nof town (in NM).\n\nAs for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work\non SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have\nsome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital\nprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for\nanother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with\nmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a\nset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.\n\nBetter news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of\nthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next\nyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.\n\nNow not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made\nfor spending half on DC.\n\nPublic support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I\'ll\nhelp you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media\nans get them to cover the flight tests.\n\n   Allen\n-- \n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Lady Astor:   "Sir, if you were my husband I would poison your coffee!"   |\n| W.

A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional\nto the position of the spot on the detector\'s face.  Let\'s try some ASCII\ngraphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)\n\n\n\n              -------------------------> 1\n             |                       |\n             |                       |       |\\\n           -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\n           XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\n           XXXXX|                            |      \\        -------\n    light >XXXXX|                            |        \\_____ divider __ output\n           XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------\n           XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |\n           XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2\n           XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /\n           XXXXX|         \\ /        |       |/\n           XXXXX| anode              |\n           XXXXX                     |\n           ----- cathode 2           |\n             |                       |\n             |                       |\n             --------------------------> 2\n\nIf the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position\nof the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-\ntion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n        2. X terminals\n        3. NeXT\n        4. Silicon Graphics\n        5. IBM RS/6000\n\t6. Other stuff\n\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n\n\tIf you\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\n\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\'re going to have a hard time finding\n\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\n\truns the X window system, you\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\n\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\n\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\n\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\n\n\tThe two main programs I\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\n\n\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\n\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\n\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\n\tserver can do this, run \'xdpyinfo\' and see if any of these strings\n\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\'t have this,\n\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\n\tor bugging your vendor.\n\n\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\n\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\'t seen it.\n\n\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\n\n    2. X terminals\n\n\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\n\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\n\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\n\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\n\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\n\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\n\n    3. NeXT\n\n\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\n\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\n\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\n\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\n\n    4. Silicon Graphics\n\n\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\n\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\'t\n\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\'s not\n\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\n\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\n\tdetails.\n\n    5. IBM RS/6000\n\n\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\n\tUnfortunately, you can\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\n\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\n\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\n\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\n\tworks.  However, they don\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\'ve been  ||\n\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\n\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t    ||\n    \n    6. Other stuff\n\n\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\n\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\n\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\n\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\n\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\n\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\n\n\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\n    Sales offices all over the place.\n\n    Availability: February, 1993\n    Price: $219\n    Supports: Mac only\n\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\n\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\n\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\n\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I\'ll have a detailed blurb from\n    TidBITS available there.\n\n\nFlexPro Keyboard\n    Key Tronic\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\n\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\n    Price: $489 (?)\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\n\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It\'s\n    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both\n    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.\n    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.\n\n    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will\n    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.\n\n\nDragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)\n    Dragon Systems, Inc.\n    320 Nevada Street\n    Newton, MA  02160\n\n    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200\n    Fax: 617-527-0372\n\n    Shipping: Now.\n\n    Price: DragonDictate-30K -- $4995 (end user system)\n\t   DragonWriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)\n\t   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.\n    \n    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only\n\t\t   (3rd party support for Mac)\n\n\tFree software support for X windows is also available -- your\n\tPC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a\n\tserial cable or network.

They sell you\n    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number\n    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.\n\n    Each user `trains\' the system to their voice, and there are provisions\n    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple\n    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file\n    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.\n    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between\n    words.

Each of the four main fingers has five\n    switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  The thumbs have\n    a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles\n    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is\n    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.

The layout resembles the\n    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each\n    section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."  Each section\n    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each\n    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three\n    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each\n    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections\n    flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).\n\n\nKinesis Ergonomic Keyboard   206-455-9220\n    206-455-9233 (fax)\n\n    Kinesis Corporation\n    15245 Pacific Highway South,\n    Seattle, Washington 98188, U.S.A.\n\n    Shirley Lunde (VP Marketing -- contact)\n\n    Shipping: Now.\n\n    Supports: PC.

Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize\n    finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,\n    backspace, etc.).\n\n    You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won\'t\n    allow the reconfig).\n\n    Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the\n    keyboard (shift, control, whatever).\n\n\nMaltron\t\t(+44) 081 398 3265 (United Kingdom)\n    P.C.D.

This directory can be used for things like\narticles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,\nthe RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It\'s not\nmeant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.\n\nSo, in the future if you\'re looking for something check there first\nand then ask here.\n\nInstructions:\n\nShort version for techies:\n\nThe site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the\ndirectory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands\nget, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command "type binary"\nto be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved\nto the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.\n\nI will maintain an index which you should get first to check if\nthe file you want to read or write already is archived.\n\nLong version for non-techies:\n\nIn order for you to use this archive your computer must be on\nthe Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:\n\n\tftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu\n\nIf that doesn\'t work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp\ncommand is successful you\'ll get this prompt asking you for a\nlogin:\n\tName (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):\n\nInstead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:\n\n\tftp\n\nNext you\'ll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:\n\n\tGuest login ok, send e-mail address as password:\n\nI would enter:\n\n\tl.v.cipriani@att.com\n\nYou\'ll enter your own e-mail address.  You\'ll get these lines\nor similar as output:\n\n\tRemote system is UNIX.\n\tUsing binary mode to transfer files.\n\nNext, the command prompt is printed:\n\n\tftp> \n\nIf you do not get the line "Using binary mode to transfer files."\nRun the command:\n\n\ttype binary\n\nNow you\'re logged in to the archive machine.  There are many\ndirectories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are\n\n\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nand\n\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nThere are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.\n\nWhen you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive\nfiles change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:\n\n\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\nor\n\tcd pub/firearms/politics/rkba\n\nTo submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with\nthe command:\n\n\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\nor\n\tcd pub/firearms/politics/incoming\n\nOnce you do this you\'ll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter\nanother command.\n\nTo find the names of the existing files in the directory you are\nin run the command:\n\n\tls -l\n\nThis will produce something like:\n\ntotal 6021\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias\n-r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu\n... and so on ...\n\nEach line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields\nare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of\nthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need\nto be concerned with.\n\nTo get a file run the command "get" followed by the name of the file\nyou want, for example:\n\n\tget INDEX\nor\n\tget noduty\n\nAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:\n\n\tTransfer complete.\n\t19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)\n\nYou can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.\nYou can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the\nfile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025\nyou should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first\nand then retrieve it:\n\n\tcd congress/103rd\n\tget HR1025\n\nOnce you\'re finished you can log off with the command:\n\n\tquit\n\nIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little\ndifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file already\nexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above\nand look it over to make sure you wouldn\'t repeat an entry.  The\nindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkba\ndirectory.  For example:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFile: whitemanslaw\n\nWhite Man\'s Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985\nReason magazine\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you\'ve determined you won\'t be duplicating an entry, login\nand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once\nyou are in the incoming directory use the command:\n\n\tput file_name\n\nIn this case:\n\n\tput whitemanslaw\n\nAgain there\'ll be a "Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered\nin so many seconds" message.  Now your file is on the archive\nmachine.\n\nAnother thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure\nthere isn\'t a file in the incoming directory that is called the same\nas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you\'ll\noverwrite the previous file [or you\'ll get an error message].\n\nYour file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a\nfile by the same name in the rkba directory.\n\nOnce your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for\nthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.\n\nIf you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute\na file email the file to me and I\'ll take care of the rest.\n\nIf you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so\nbe sure to let me know first.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n-- \nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nMichael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..\n                (internal) mjp@bwa.kgn.ibm.com .. mjp at kgnvmy         \n (and last but not least a disclaimer)  These opinions are mine..       \n'

Science\nLines: 37\nDistribution: usa\nNNTP-Posting-Host: tomato.cis.ohio-state.edu\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI\'m an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I\'d\nlike to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to\nuse cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation\nconsoles date from the early 60\'s and don\'t provide this function.\n\nWe already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,\nand our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control\ncircuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.\n\nI\'ve tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the\ncue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there\'s one\nproblem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be\na sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,\nso to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid\ncuetape!)\n\nIdeally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.\n(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)\nThis would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.\nWhat I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay\nfor around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay\nis activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit\nof some sort.  I\'m sure some of you already have the solution figured\nout in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nMark Fontana\n\n-- \n "Of all the arts, the cinema is  |  Mark A.

There\nused to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in\nTexas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.\nControllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses\nthough.

But we know\nenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.\nThere are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over\nto begin a turn.\n\n\t1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.\n\n\t2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.\n\n\t3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a\n\ttorque which twists the bike over.\n\nTake an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,\n15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be\nneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each\neffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at\nhigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off\nbugger all, relatively speaking.\n\nBy the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to\nrun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast?

Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss "chorion" so I\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\n\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich "Greek Lexicon" renders\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\nindeed "chorion." \n\nNow I\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\n\n\t"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Louw and Nida\n\t"Robinson\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament"\n\t"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Grimm\n\t"Word study Concordance," Tynsdale\n\t"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \n\t early Christian Writings," Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\n\t"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon," Perschbacher\n\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\n\n\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, "country place," \n\tland, farm, estate, "a bit of tillage", and similar meanings.\n\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about "grave." As some of these \nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\'s investigations into "contradictions" to \nbe once again, as your friend said it, "lacking in substance," and thus Archer \nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\nto support Mr Archer\'s contentions). \n\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\'s) is the definition of\n"agros," the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\n"agros" is defined as "a field in the country." Chorion is specifically noted\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\nBullinger\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for "field" in Matthew\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for "field" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\nwhich drives the point home). \n\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\ndiscussing the "Potter\'s Field."\n \n\t\t\t\tLater,\n\n\t\t\t\tDave Butler\n\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\n\t\t\t\tHenry Ward Beecher\n\t\t\t\tAmerican Clergyman\n\t\t\t\tas recorded by George Seldes\n'

An atheist is one for whom all things can\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\n\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\nspiritual explanations. \n\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn\'t: it is self-\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \n\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\nfrom its stern and stony eye.

I think the question does not have\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\nwill or not? \n\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\n: acquire intelligence, it\'s just a happy accident.\n\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\nsurvive, those which don\'t don\'t make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\n\n: For an atheist, no\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\n: an event can have value. \n\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \n\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\nfor starters.\n\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God?

The argument is\nseverely flawed.\n\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\'s\nown people.\n\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\nof other nations. \n\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\n\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value.

Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\n: no weight in any "absolute" sense.\n\nIt looks like you haven\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\nof some physical event), and other\'s happiness, too, if the observer\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\nmeaning. \n\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\ndo not exist. \n\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others\'\nexistence.\n\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \n\n: That you don\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n: or God\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\'ve been\n: conditioned; there is no "truth" content. The whole of your\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\n\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\n\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\ncease to be subjective. \n\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \ninherently subjective. \n\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\nwe don\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\'s\nown and then to get mad at this. \n\nGod must be schizophrenic.\n\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n: weight whatsoever.\n\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\n\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \n\nPetri\n\n--\n ___. .\'*\'\'.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.\n!___.\'* \'.\'*\' \' .

As we are all different, we quite obviously require \ndifferent levels of evidence.\n\n\tAs one pointed out, one\'s history is important.

If one of the \nconsequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of \naffairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law, \nthey are irrelevent when theorizing about the "Truth" of the law.\n\n\tGiven that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including \nthe consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of \naffiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find\n"The Truth"?\n\n\n\n\tBy the way, what is "Truth"? Please define before inserting it in \nthe conversation. Please explain what "Truth" or "TRUTH" is. I do think that \nanything is ever known for certain.

Those who subscribe to\n_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone\ncomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the\ncontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads\nis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the\nfamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.\nThe letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that\nNefertiti was "a beautiful black queen."  This set off an exchange of\nhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had\nan article from an Egyptologist titled "Was Cleopatra Black?"  (The answer\nto the title is "no"-- she was greek.)\n\nI have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I\npersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in\nWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary\nenourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark\nhair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and\ndown the Mediterranean.\n\n(Also, if what I remember is correct, the "Black Madonna" doesn\'t represent\na person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe\nBuehler....?)\n\nIn the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that\ngreeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus,\nthe situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians,\nor various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about\nthe Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then\nthere are the Ethiopians....\n\nThose of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these\npeople are "white" (i.e., of the racist\'s "race").  If I may risk a\npotentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the\nidentification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering\nthe extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval\nantisemitism on the other, I don\'t think that this "Jesus was white" thesis\never played the roles that some hold it did.\n\nRepresentations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems\nawfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one\'s own racial group.\n-- \nC.

A fully loaded\nSL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be\nsomewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might\nstart around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000\nif you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream\nTaurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little\ninaccurate.\n\n>\n>\tI can't see Saturn is of better value and that is why I was puzzled\n>\tby its pricings. Oh, we did not spend much time getting our deals;\n>\tbeing better informed has its advantages.\n\nWell, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some\nof the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that\nis best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by\nthe Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.\n\n>\t\n>\tThen again, I may be wrong.\n>\n>Yung-Kao Hsu\n>\n\nMihir Shah\nmps1@cec1.wustl.edu\n"

In each of these cases, the suspension geometry\nwill suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the\nintended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom\nof the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore\nthe suspension geometry.

OldPos 8263 | 18 b'From: crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com (Ron Phillips)\nSubject: Randy Weaver Trial - Day 2 \nNntp-Posting-Host: hound\nReply-To: crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com\nOrganization: "Intergraph Electronics, Mountain View, CA"\nDistribution: usa\nLines: 89\n\nThis was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n==============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nWednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the "evil" federal\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\nagents "sawed off" shotguns and later failed to appear for\ntrial: Despite repeated "good faith" efforts to get Weaver\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\nwere taking an "offensive action" against an FBI helicopter\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\n\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\nalleged, want to become a "regular supplier").  The defense also\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\nhe wouldn\'t become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\nangle of the story.  We\'ll know more as things develop].  The\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\nWeaver\'s dog that was in proximity to Weaver\'s son, Samuel.  Weaver\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to "look at the body" [not recover?]\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\n\nProsecution quote: "Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\nthat confrontation." -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\n\nDefense quote: "The evidence in this case is going to show that\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\nwith crimes they didn\'t commit in order to cover crimes that\nthe government did commit."  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\n\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday\'s protests\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\n"Tim" again.  "Tim" claimed he was a skinhead, who were "ordinary,\nworking class people."  He also claimed he was for "white pride,\nnot white power."\n\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\n\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\ncourthouse.

Some\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\nrecounting of his wife\'s death), and Spence compared the "sawed\noff" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\ngood one!).\n\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\nbegin presenting evidence.\n\nDrew\n=============================================================\n\n\n-- \n**************************************************************\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\n**************************************************************\n'

It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.\nThere are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and\nthe software.  THAT IS IT.\nLet us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.\n\nSCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}\n asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}\n synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a\n rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}\n\nSCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from\n SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs\n this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers\n AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the \n slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode \n 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous\n mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}\n\nSCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things\n over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the\n machine and the external device.\n Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver\n software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.\n Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.\n\nSCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this\n requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING\n devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY\n expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts\n \n\nAs I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the \ncontroler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to\nonly FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}\n"

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

Because of the above mentioned licensing\nproblem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress\na board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.\n\nSince Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes\nin Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.\nWhich is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since\nthey're being so stinky.

Our agency started to express interest in\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies "The Terminater 2" and "Lawnmover\n|> Man".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\n\n\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\nper second).\n\n\n|> \n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\n|> companies,\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\n\n\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\ndata representations.\n\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\neven SGI\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\n\n\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\n\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

We need to\nfix the problems you\'ve noted (they were already on the list).  If\nyou\'re really interested, though, take a look at the text file\nP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the\nP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,\nyou can build up a new monitor definition that has the right\ncombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy\nof the file!  Once you\'ve built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT\nfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices\nshould show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.\nYou can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of\nthe driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.

In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn\'t as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn\'t support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn\'t run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier\'s Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus \'Generic\', and if you choose Generic you can\'t get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don\'t know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn\'t have\nthe problem.  He didn\'t know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don\'t have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren\'t really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.

This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. \n   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1\non IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of\nthe interrupts in between. Works just great.\n   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that\ndetails how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the\nhigher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.\n\n  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9.

You realize it\nwould not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the\nlast several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would\nbegin to look like the biased attack that it is.\n\n   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for\nPolicy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot\nwho hates Israel.\n\n   Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel?  I\nhave heard that your family once lived in Israel, but the members\nof your family could not cut the competition there.  Is this true\nabout your family?  Is this true about you?  Is this actually not\nabout Israel, but is really a personal vendetta?  Why are you not\nthe least bit objective about Israel?  Do you think that the name\nof your phony-baloney center hides your bias in the least?  Get a\nclue, Mr. Davidsson.  Haven't you realized yet that when you post\nsuch stupidity in this group, you are going to incur answers from\npeople who are armed with the truth?  Haven't you realized that a\npiece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a\ntruth?  Haven't you realized that you are in over your head?  The\npeople who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or\nneed them to be.  This is not the place for such pseudo-analysis.\nYou will be continually ripped to shreds, until you start to show\nsome regard for objectivity.  Or you can continue to show what an\nanti-Israel zealot you are, trying to disguise your bias behind a\npompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research.'  You ought to\nknow that you are a laughing stock, your 'Center' is considered a\njoke, and until you either go away, or make at least some attempt\nto be objective, you will have a place of honor among the clowns,\nbigots, and idiots of Usenet.\n"

Oh wait, you\nchose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact \nOPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don\'t think that it\'s\nbecause it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was\nEgypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs\nwho refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET\nBY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli\nshipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response\nto years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan\nHeights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel\nfinally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that \nthe borders could be expanded.\n \n   Steve\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|   Internet: aa229@freenet.carleton.ca              Fidonet: 1:163/109.18   |\n|             Mossad@qube.ocunix.on.ca                                       |\n|    <<My opinions are not associated with anything, including my head.>>    |\n'

Many of these events are not even mentioned here.\nI read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which\nyou know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media\nfor your information on Israel.  Since I read both American media\nand Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody\nwho reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about\nIsrael does not have a true picture of what is going on.\n\n   As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased, of course they\nare.  Some may lean to the right or the left, just like the media\nhere in America.  But they still report events about which people\nhere know nothing.  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and\nthe mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American\nwho relies exclusively on an American media which does not report\non events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.\n\n'

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \n\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \ndiseases via this route...so it\'s good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \nbeing poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and            \nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any \'cooties\' that \nhaven\'t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body\'s exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I\'m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \n\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu\n                                                                                                    \n  \n'

(alveolus?)\n    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done\n    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen\n    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\n\n  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\n    gas per unit volume. \n\n  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs\nor interfere with their healing or anything like that... \n\n--\nWim Lewis, wiml@u.washington.edu\n"

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

"He was\nsupposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn\'t obey his\nown rules."\n\tThe documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped\nwould be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after\nWorld War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.\n\tHimmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than\n100 German secret police generals.  "I also want to talk to you,\nquite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be\nmentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.\nI mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish\nrace.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been\nwritten and is never to be written."  [Emphasis mine--rje]\n\tThe German word Himmler uses that is translated as\n"extermination" is *Ausrottung*.\n\tWolfe said a more precise translation would be "extirpation"\nor "tearing up by the roots."\n\tIn his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,\n"Judenevakuierung" or "evacuation of the Jews."  But archives\nofficials said "extermination" is the word he actually\nspoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.\n\tHimmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler\'s "final solution of the\nJewish question," committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.\n\tThe National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is\na preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum here on April 26.\n\tThe National Archives exhibit includes a page each of\nHimmler\'s handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and\nan offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.\n\n\t---From p.A10 of Saturday\'s L.A.

That is, ignoring concerns about government\nintrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to\ninvestigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,\nand their customers, to support this wiretap technology?  \n\nA rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million\ndollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.\nwiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28\nbillion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)\nI\'m working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but\nI\'d like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating\nthe costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.\n\nPlease send me quotable/citeable estimates for:\n\n- How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all\n  phones with wiretap chips?\n- How much would it cost to make each chip?\n- How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?\n- How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?\n- What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been\n  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?\n- What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed\n  "law enforcement blocks"?\n- What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?\n\nPut another way, the question I\'m asking is, what if each police\nagency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being\ncharged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication\nto be wiretap compatible?

Drag free may already have\nbeen flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would\nmore accurately respond to motions from the Earth\'s gravity field and\nignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball\nfloating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little\nadjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would\nthen be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity\nanisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously\nadjusting its position to compensate for drag.\n\n\nJoseph Cain\t\tcain@geomag.gly.fsu.edu   \ncain@fsu.bitnet\t\tscri::cain\n(904) 644-4014\t\tFAX (904) 644-4214 or -0098\n'

The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.\nIt becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the\nwing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.\n\nIf they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force\ncompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).\n\nIf you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend\ninto,  then drag is reduced.   \n\nEssentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf\nremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are\nsubtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.\n\npat\n'
