I don\'t argue\nthat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I\njust question whether you >should<.\n\nThe fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we\ncan\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I\nreally hope I do, but I\'m not holding my self-similar breath.\n\n> There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal\n> image compression.\n\nUh huh.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  I\'ve been chasing fractal\ncompression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so\ngreat, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t,\nI\'ll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first\n\tencoding devices in the summer, he says.

Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic\n>phil. of sci. texts as an example of the inventive component of\n>hypothesizing. \n\nAnd has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-\nBernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

I would offer some rather well known examples\nsuch as Toricelli\'s Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air"\nhypothesis.

Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)\nout of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and\nwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.\nThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty\nat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, one\ncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new\ndomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you\nlike.\n-- \nGary H.

However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

The Bible "ends"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God\'s reign end there ?

This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.

However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.

The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

2 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

In other\nwords, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,\nnavigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. \nYou wouldn\'t want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I\'d hate to see\nfolks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch\nsystem comes on line.\n\nI guess I\'d simplify this to say that \'waste\' is a slippery concept.  If\nyour goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its\nnot \'wasted\' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500\nmillion, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.\n\nCraig\n\n\nCraig Keithley           |"I don\'t remember, I don\'t recall, \nApple Computer, Inc.     |I got no memory of anything at all"\nkeithley@apple.com       |Peter Gabriel, Third Album (1980)\n'

17 b"From: szabo@techbook.com (Nick Szabo)\nSubject: SSF Redesign: Constellation\nSummary: decentralize & automate functions\nKeywords: space station, constellation\nArticle-I.D.: techbook.C51z6E.CL1\nOrganization: TECHbooks --- Public Access UNIX --- (503) 220-0636\nLines: 89\n\nSSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

I was just wondering if we could have some kind\n>of update on DC-X.\n\nWell it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting\nready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out\nof town (in NM).\n\nAs for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work\non SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have\nsome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital\nprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for\nanother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with\nmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a\nset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.\n\nBetter news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of\nthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next\nyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.\n\nNow not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made\nfor spending half on DC.\n\nPublic support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I\'ll\nhelp you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media\nans get them to cover the flight tests.\n\n   Allen\n-- \n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Lady Astor:   "Sir, if you were my husband I would poison your coffee!"   |\n| W.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.\n\n==clip==\n"

Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)\'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can\'t allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\n>  program.\n\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n\nNow, the phrasing of this question says "if a line intersects a polygon", so\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\n\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\nnew language called PostScript.  (See "PostScript Language", by Adobe Systems\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\n\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By\n"output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", which\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\nthe original problem.\n\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \n\n\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\n\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\n\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n\n\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\n\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\n\tother words, will it halt?\n\n\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\n\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\n\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\n\tout to be undecidable.\n\n\nI won\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\n\nA couple of references might be:\n\n1.

Obfusc.\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\n\n--------\n\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\n\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that\'s ONLY if you restrict\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\nsecond derivative.  (I think there\'s an \'89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that\ndeals with this).\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n J o n a s   Y n g v e s s o n          email: jonas-y@isy.liu.se\nDept. of Electrical Engineering\t        voice:  +46-(0)13-282162          \nUniversity of Linkoping, Sweden         fax  :  +46-(0)13-139282\n'

The only way \nto get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The \n"gain" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred \ndirection) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.\n\nBob Sciamanda\nEdinboro Univ of PA\n'

However, it\'s still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It\'s probably the\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\n\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\nhere\'s what he told me:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is what is included:\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for\n          analog output.\n        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).\n        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\n        - Rechargable battery.\n\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don\'t mind if I keep the 60 minute\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\n\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he\'s including an\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        I\'m not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\n\n        Again, I\'ve used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I\'ve been using one for a little\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine\nthat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher\nConspiracy for their recent live album.)\n\n        Bryan Davis says:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels\nin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported\nproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        \'nuff said.\n\n        The reason I\'m not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don\'t have any\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn\'t.  (I am also paying more\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\n\n        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,\nby the way.)\n\n        Anyway, if you\'re interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.\n\n-- \nJohn Davison\ndavisonj@ecn.purdue.edu\n'

Three questions come to mid real quick for something like\nthis.\n\nQ:\tWhich version of Adobe PS will we clone?\n\tAside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released\n\tnew code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other\n\tsoftware vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure\n\tyou,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to\n\tdwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to\n\tmaintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.\n\nQ:\tDo we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?\n\tFrom the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had\n\ta number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding\n\twhich approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.\n\nQ:\tDo we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?\n\tWithout a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's\n\tPS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does\n\tleave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be\n\tnice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two\n\tdifferent implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given\n\tan identical set of conditions.\n\nQ:\tPSCRIPT.DRV?\n\tHaving done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of\n\ttesting is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary\n\tsource we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,\n\t(1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,\n\tbut the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe\n\tuses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its\n\twrong.\n\nYes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub\nof Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack\nof design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor\nbecause the vendors don't know what PS is.\n\nDon Newbold\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdon@rastek.com\n"

Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle.\nSo I cut a piece of 3/8" thick wood to about 16.25" x 12", covered it in a \ncream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris\'s top\nand the monitor!!\n\nMick Mueck  mick.mueck@analog.com\n\n     **************** I HATE *CHIPSOFT\'S* MacINTAX *******************\n\n'

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\n\n\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\n\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\n\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\n--  \n=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=\n Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org\n'

Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\'s special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\'t work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can\'t go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\'t tell you all the things I\'ve tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.\n-- \nGary H.

The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.

Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

I\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it\'s worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.

Biomedical research doesn\'t make any basic \nassumptions that aren\'t the same as any other discipline of scientific\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \n"the old Newtonian model of the world".

This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting\nscience and research can\'t seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a \ncreative process.

However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\nIn article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com \n    (Dick King) writes:\n>  [ Somebody writes: ]\n>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....\n>  ....\n>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a\n>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.\n>         ....\n>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out\n>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If it\'s not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it\'s not science."\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don\'t in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin\'s\nassertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors.")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.

I sold my (well maintained)\n'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.\nAll that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings\nand seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,\n\n _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________\n|                                                              |\n| Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    |\n| Hewlett-Packard Co.

But the city\'s cable channel (35 in CableVision areas)\nshows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I\nbelieve).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.  The\ncomputer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red\n(respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and "incident"--I might be off\na little on the speeds, since this is from memory).\n\nI often look at this display in the morning to see if I really want to\nfight the traffic on the Sepulveda Pass or work from home for a little\nwhile to wait for it to clear.\n\nAnother poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded\nwire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.

Since we apparently\ndon\'t have the sensor base you folks have, they\'re installing\ncameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests\nare going to be in the Santa Clara area I\'m told), with the\nvideo being piped into a command center they\'re building\nsomewhere in the East Bay.  I\'m not sure if frame grabbers or\ncheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large\nmulti-colored status displays will show the various routes\nusing different colors to represent the various average speeds\nfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front\nof the status \'wall\', and will relay continuous verbal traffic\nstatus to those who want to receive it.  They\'re apparently also\nlooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to\nproviding continuous audio from this system.\n\nIn the mean time, they\'ll set up large incandescent display\nboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data\non traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the\nsystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it\nwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\n"cheap").\n\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\nreceivers like the \'Auto Talk\' that the information coming next is\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they\'re probably using some\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\ndon\'t have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\nmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)\n\nI think we\'d all be interested in a summary post if you get more\ninfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.\n\nCheers,\nAlan\n<acooney@netcom.com>\n\n'

I won the battle but \nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet\'s \nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\n\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \na "use deduction" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \nfor my insurance.\n\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \nthat required attention included the transmission, \nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\n\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\n\n'

The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

(Poor you!)\n\nThe Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you \nsouldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of \ncopying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to \nthe protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the \nprotection.\n\nOne thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape \nfor viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an \nextra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR \nfirst, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I \ndon't know if they would react or not.

Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  \ntrying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  \nthat the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  \nwrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  \ncould be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   \nIt could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  \nwrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  \ncorrect actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  \nmy NeXT that way.\n\nNow I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  \nproblem, and at pretty high speeds too.\n\nI don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  \npretty standard.\n\nHope this helps,\n-Avery\n"

If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that\nyesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be\nreading this was there for it and remembers that it happened.\nBut *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere.\nYou need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that\nyou remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything\nyou clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you\nhallucinated the whole thing.\n\nTo talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the\nterms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the\nresurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.\n\nI think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is\never disproved.

It\'s use as prayer language seems especially troubling\nto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing\nthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is\nGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go\nby the Pentecost use where it\'s an actual language.\n\nMoreover, the phrase "though I speak with the tongues of men and angels"\nused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then\nassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it\nis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.\n\nHmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how\nGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that\nif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one\namongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.\n\nSo why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE\nANOTHER?  It\'s disturbing to think that some people find ways to \njustify jabbering.\n\nBut I\'ll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.\n\nTrouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at\nverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that\nthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright\nfabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post\nseems like a "friend of a friend" thing.  And linguistically, a two\nsyllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.\n\nMuch as many faith healers have trouble proving their "victories" (since\nmost ailments "cured" are just plain unprovable) and modern day\nressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that no\nmodern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.\n'

Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

Andrew Kille writes:\n\n>Are you suggesting that God supports genocide?\n>Perhaps the Germans were "punishing" Jews on God\'s behalf?\n> \n>Any God who works that way is indescribably evil, and unworthy of\n>my worship or faith.\n\nThe Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).\n And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is\njust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the\ninevitablity of the sucess of God\'s plan, and this is especially hard to\ngrasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are\ndoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it\nmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to\nthe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is\npossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\nplan might be accomplished.\n    But don\'t forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\nfulfill the chorus of "Let his blood be upon our hands" of the crowd in\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \nDon\'t you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, "Mene, mene,\ntekel, peres?"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God\'s\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\nquite clear.\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\nJesus Christ is as follows: "Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\nhand."  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - "Let\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me."  There is not an infinite\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, "well, alright,\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\nplans."  He said "Follow me."  His message is NOT "I\'m just a sweety-pie\nwho would never hurt a fly, you\'ve got all the time in the world, and\nDivine Judgement, that\'s only a fairy tale."  "Our great God and Savior"\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\nworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be\nquestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\n\nD.

GANDLER) writes:\n>\n>\tHow does the radio Electronics free information cards work.\n>Do they just send you some general information about the companies that\n>advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a\n>catalog. \n\nThat depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.\nRadio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser\ngets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers\nwho circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\ndata on computer disk.\n\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\na "bingo card" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\n\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that "23% of readers\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors." And finally, some\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\'s, in the past 6 months.\n\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the "literature collectors" from\nthe serious potential customers.\n\n"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could."\n\nWhat\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\n\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\n  weeks later.\n\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\n  on a computer printout.\n\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\'re\n  not really "qualified" for, send in a bingo card at least every\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\n\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it\'s your house.\n  Advertisers almost never call. \n\nJohn Schuch\n  publisher of: The Arizona High-Tech Times\n                The Arizona Electrical Journal\n                The Arizona HVAC News\n  (all of which have bingo cards)\n\n\n'

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\n\n\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\n\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\n\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\n--  \n=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=\n Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org\n'

In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn\'t as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn\'t support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn\'t run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier\'s Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus \'Generic\', and if you choose Generic you can\'t get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don\'t know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn\'t have\nthe problem.  He didn\'t know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don\'t have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren\'t really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.

We need to\nfix the problems you\'ve noted (they were already on the list).  If\nyou\'re really interested, though, take a look at the text file\nP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the\nP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,\nyou can build up a new monitor definition that has the right\ncombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy\nof the file!  Once you\'ve built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT\nfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices\nshould show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.\nYou can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of\nthe driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,\ntoo.)\n\n>The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\n>Speedy program.

So I\'d take the\nnumbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing\nwith WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the\n8514, as if anyone cared.)  It\'s safer (though not safe) to use\nbenchmarks from "unbiased" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,\netc.\n\n\n>Interestingly, the solid\n>vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\n>filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.

What\'s kind of silly is IIT\'s\nuse of a hardwired "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then\nsat on a tack" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in\nreal applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the "Bart\nSimpson optimization," in which you save the bitmap of the\nmost-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a\nscreen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a\nsecond time in a row.

They\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before "the night of the\nlong knives". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\nescapes me at the moment) called "Homosexuals in History" asserts that Roehm\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\'s SA circle.\n\n>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,\n>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and\n>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. \n\nWell, you\'re the one who is in Germany. If you don\'t believe the history books,\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the "knight of the\nlong knives" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\'s\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\'ve \nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \n\n>(Irving, a\n>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance\n>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)\n\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\'t you think they \nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \n\n>I challenge anyone to document this claim.\n\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\n\n>I *have* found a great\n>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the\n>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,\n>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.\n\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\n\nI don\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\'s friends\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\'s homosexuality.\n\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality.\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\n\nNo, I don\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\'t have the time. Nothing is\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\n                                                                           \n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\nDavid Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)\n"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softly\nof us in days hereafter..."

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.

Simon P.

We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - "you\'ve lost it!"  The "me" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened\nto your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn\nV\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!\n\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\nAmerican.  Let\'s go fly it!\n'

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]\n\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\'s idea -- Any Takers?\n'

The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.\nIt becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the\nwing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.\n\nIf they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force\ncompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).\n\nIf you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend\ninto,  then drag is reduced.   \n\nEssentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf\nremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are\nsubtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.\n\npat\n'

Obviously, it\nis no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published\ndocuments to find material to use against Israel makes it so.  \n\n   Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising\nin itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was\ncurious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind\nhis phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some\ntypical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'

OldPos 735 | 9 b'From: jer@prefect.cc.bellcore.com (rathmann,janice e)\nSubject: Re: Sinus vs. Migraine (was Re: Sinus Endoscopy)\nOrganization: Bellcore, Livingston, NJ\nSummary: Headaches and analgesics\nLines: 95\n\n\nI noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\nI generally don\'t take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I\'ve\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I\'ve tried Synarel, it reduced\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\nonly "real solution" to my problem.  Although I don\'t expect to have\nany more children, I don\'t like the idea of having my uterus and\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\nto have children.  So basically all I\'m left with is toughing out\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn\'t work, and Motrin gave me\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I\'m through with it).  In\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \nlegs) as I\'ll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it\'s actually quite effective\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\nI\'m frequently in severe pain.\n\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I\'ve had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\n(I\'ve had 2 of them, and don\'t intend to ever do that again) with\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\n"internal nerves" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I\'d \nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don\'t have\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\n\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can\'t avoid them entirely because\nI have other pain sources, that "force" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\nbut I\'m avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\na reduced capacity (I\'m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can\'t concentrate much,\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\nI can\'t really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\nI\'ve taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\nI reduced the dosage), but I don\'t like the side effects (if I take\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn\'t very helpful when\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I\'ve tried several other medications\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\nthey either didn\'t work, or I couldn\'t tolerate them.  So what can I do?\nMy doctor\'s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\npain.  I\'ve had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\nsuccinylcholine), and I\'ve already had surgery several times.\n\nAnyway, the point of what I\'m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\n\nJanice Rathmann\n\n'

It\'s\noften practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of\nnon-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal\nevidence given by the patient. It\'s an educated guess, by a trained person,\nbut it\'s still no more than a guess.\nIt\'s cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those\npeople who don\'t respond.\n\nThere are diseases that haven\'t been described yet and the root cause of many\ndiseases now described aren\'t known. (Read a book on gastroenterology\nsometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have\nrun out then it\'s the patient\'s freedom of choice to try any experimental\nmethod they choose. And it\'s well recognized by many doctors that medicine\ndoesn\'t have all the answers.\n\nThis person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it\'s a\nmiracle cure, maybe it\'s valid. How do you know?  \n\nYou might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaging\nattack is unwarranted.

He\'s kept a record of the results, and for over \n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\nprogram.\n\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\nsymptoms outlined in \'The Yeast Connection\' (I agree it is a poorly \nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I\'m also\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\n\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out that\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\nsorts, and again, you don\'t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\nsince that\'s the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there\'s\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\n\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You\'ll find\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\n\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\nto the party line are academics who haven\'t been in the trenches long enough\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\nface that there is no evidence of the \'yeast connection\', I cannot guarantee\ntheir safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as\nfar as I am concerned.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\n\nIf you\'re dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I\'ll send info.\n=============================================================================\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED\'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World\'s Best!    |\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\n=============================================================================\nWho are you?

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n'

OldPos 2 | 8 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"

What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"
