I don\'t argue\nthat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I\njust question whether you >should<.\n\nThe fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we\ncan\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.

I\'ve been chasing fractal\ncompression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so\ngreat, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t,\nI\'ll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.

Now, the\n>complication is that one of my best friends has become very\n>fundamentalist. That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he\n\nHello.  Firstly, what do you exactly mean by "fundamentalist"?  I will\nfor the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes\nthat the bible is God\'s word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened\nto him is what he\'ll call being "born again"?  Anyway, was that recent?\nIf the answer is "yes" to all the questions above, it is quite\nunderstandable.  However, IMO, I\'ld rather give advice to your friend!\nI think I\'ve been through something similar to him, and one thing I can\nsay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to\ncommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things\nis because they are now "obvious" to him.  What is "obvious" to him is\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\nfrom his point of view, he has been on "both sides of the fence".  This\nI mean that before he turned "fundamentalist", you two are agreeable\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\ndiscovery of let\'s say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he\'s\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\nhowever, he may not realise that he\'s really putting you off.\n\n[...]\n\n>the Bible that it is so.\'  So my question is, how can I convince him\n>that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve\n>what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great\n>friendship?  How do I convince him that I am \'beyond saving\' so he\n>won\'t try?  Thanks for any advice.\n\nSo far, I\'ve only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn\'t a Christian for a good\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\n"fundamentalists" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\n"religious belief" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he\'s\ntrying to convince you about, that it\'s beyond you or not your concern\n"for now".  Don\'t tell him it\'s nonsense, because to him it is reality -\nand that would be a real insult.  He\'ll also have to be careful not to\ninsult where you stand too.\n\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\nI\'ll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\nand just blabbered away about what I\'ve found!  To me, it was too good\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn\'t really care most of\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he\'s crazy too -\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\nmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real\nto him, he doesn\'t see why God can\'t be real to you too.\n\nI don\'t know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -\nthis is quite a challenge for you to face.

See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

The net result of this is\nthat you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the\nNational Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances\nof hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.\n\nI think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer\nto Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal with\nnature on it's own terms.\n\nGuy\n"

I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?

My\nneeds\nare much the same as what you describe.  In addition, I wanted to get one\nthat\nI could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of\ninexpensive \nprinters from Apple.  The print quality is good to excellent based on\nwhat \nfont you're using and what paper you use.  I'm still experimenting with \ndifferent papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work\nfine.\n\nPrinting envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed\njobs is\nvery easy.  There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of\nthe\nsheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet\nfrom\nthe sheet feeder, as some do).\n\n(I have no affiliation with GCC, just a satisfied customer.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarl D.

While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the\nWindows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit\nmodes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.  Any feedback will be appreciated.\n\nThe system configuration is:\n\nGateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus\n16 Megs Ram\nSCSI HD & CD-ROM\nUltrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller\nATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM\nDOS 6.0\nWindows 3.1\nMach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)\n\nThanks in advance.\n-- \nAli R.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

2 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria\n  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the\n  cafeteria.\n  \n  Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the\n  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the\n  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude\n  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational\n  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social\n  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available\n  either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything\n  needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.\n  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-\n  7302."\n  \nBy the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is\nit an advertisement to buy the product.

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

I have everything under control, I think, besides the\nbatteries.

I've never heard\nanyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't\nso great. But maybe someone can tell me.\n\nWould it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the\nelectrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the\ncontainer, close up the batteries, and leave them that way?

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, \nbut real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,\nscientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have \nthe money, why not?" approach.\n\nIt\'s conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it\'s possible\nthat Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it\'s most likely that\nLuna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred\nyears at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding\nlevels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you\nput a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year? Even if you\nuse grad students?\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n'

I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours\nwith this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$\nto take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and\nI've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole \nthing is going back.  \n  I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me\nthat I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also\nthe two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke\nto customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything\nup gratis.

I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm\nbeginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.\nAre other mail order companies as difficult to contact?

OldPos 4562 | 7 b"From: wellison@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu\nSubject: Re: Help with ultra-long timing\nOrganization: University of Kansas Academic Computing Services\nLines: 33\n\nThanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...\n\n-=-= Wes =-=-\n"

I would\ntend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be\nwary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard.\nIe: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane.\nSome people don\'t like these configurations. The second thing is that\nwhoever set up my computer at the factory didn\'t really know what they were\ndoing. The installed windows video driver didn\'t even take advantage of the\nSVGA card/Monitor. Look forward to configuring the system optimally\nyourself.\n\n-- \n=============================================================================\n| "Anyone have a coat hanger?

Uses VRAM.\n\nIn comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you\n  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.\n  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I\n  think it ends up costing more.\n\nGreg Dudek\n"

I know this\n: would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life\n: span of bikes. 2) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with\n: prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is\n: for cars?.\n\n: Thanks for any advice you can give.\n\n:                             --Mark\n--\n\nMark,\n\n  47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained)\n'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.\nAll that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings\nand seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,\n\n _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________\n|                                                              |\n| Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    |\n| Hewlett-Packard Co.

OldPos 6453 | 17 b"From: edw@boi.hp.com (Edward Walsh)\nSubject: Guzzi 850-T tires, plus fairing question\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard / Boise, Idaho\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\nLines: 59\n\n\n\n\nI have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic\n>phil. of sci. texts as an example of the inventive component of\n>hypothesizing. \n\nAnd has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-\nBernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.

I\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\n   stood by the Pope.\n\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\ndisobeyed.\n\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don\'t view the\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\n\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\n   authority and discipline.  \n\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\nbishops.  It\'s basically the Reformation part II.\n\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\nhour, probably.\n\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I\'m reading a book\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\n\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\n\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer\'s\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\n\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\n\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\n\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n\t the Pope\'s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n\t don\'t jointly make such  choice.)\n\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\n   If I adopt the view that "I\'m NOT wrong, I CAN\'T be wrong, and\n   there\'s NO WAY I\'ll change my mind, YOU must change yours", that\n   I\'ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn\'t go along with it is an\ninstant non-Catholic.\n\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\ndoing, they would be shocked!\n\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the "real"\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n\nThis isn\'t the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\ndoctrine is.\n\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\n   I may be wrong here, I\'m not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nThat\'s heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\nspread that it\'s pitiful.\n\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\nfact, that\'s what usually happens during a major heresy: large\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\nrun.\n\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\n   Again, I\'m not trying to be contentions, I\'m trying to understand.\n   Since I\'m Orthodox, I\'ve got no real vested interest in the outcome,\n   one way or the other.\n\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\n\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\n   Pope\'s commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\n\nNot really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last\n300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels at\ncritical thought, remember?  That\'s what Catholic theologians have\nbeen busy at for centuries.\n'

And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.

So\nthere\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people call\nTHIS science?"   (My opinion, for what it\'s worth, is that one sees both\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \n\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\'t believe it is \never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \n\n\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\n\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \n\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\'s not  as it is a \nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\'s results is an\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\n\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\ninvestigation.  \n\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \n\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\namount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as I\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \nspecific question to try and answer.  \n\nThe "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \nI certainly wasn\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \nof "reason and observation."\n\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \n\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \nis any existing research related to this question.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\n'

For all\nof current science is based on the past work of scientists whose\nmethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  \n\nIt is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine\nthose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is\nalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on \nthose early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous \nfashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  \n\nBut to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is\ncapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no\nideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly\nbe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one\'s attitude as\ndoctrinaire, cultist.

It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n"mainly about."\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.

As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n"absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.

On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.

It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\n\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \n\n\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\ninvestigation.\n\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  "If this\nhasn\'t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\nresearch then it can\'t be of any interest to us."  \n\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "There\'ve got to\nbe controlled studies" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\n\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world\'s most \nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \nit doesn\'t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\nprocess doesn\'t need to be repeated and the subject doesn\'t need to\npractice it over again at home.\n\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \n\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\'re not part of the\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \nfrom scientific acceptance.) \n\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \npsychology establishment is still saying "We don\'t have any way of \nknowing that it\'s effective."  \n\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  "Why should I prove your \ntheory?"  and  "The burden of proof is on the one making the claim."  \nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\'t \nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It\'s described in a number of \nbooks and I\'ve posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \ndetail as I\'m capable of.)  \n\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \nfavorable results), but it\'s apparently not acceptable because it\'s a\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\n\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about "doctrinnaire" \nattitudes about science.  \n\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \nIf so, I apologize. \n \n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \n\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\n'

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

But the city\'s cable channel (35 in CableVision areas)\nshows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I\nbelieve).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.

Normally, the older boards have\na 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char\nthey received.

My\nmachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from\nwhen I called the order in. \n\n   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the \nperipherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I\nwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway \ndocumentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.\nThe Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came\nwith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)\nwas properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and \nhas been performing flawlessly. It\'s been on all weekend and it hardly\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \nlot to do with it. \n\n   It\'s up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I\'ve also read about\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then "maps" the other\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can "cd" to these\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It\'s almost like a\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\nIt\'s not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \n\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\n\n  So, I\'m glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I\'m glad it\nwas me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn\n\n\n-- \nJohn Gayman, WA3WBU \nUUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john\nPacket: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH \n'

Three questions come to mid real quick for something like\nthis.\n\nQ:\tWhich version of Adobe PS will we clone?\n\tAside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released\n\tnew code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other\n\tsoftware vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure\n\tyou,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to\n\tdwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to\n\tmaintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.\n\nQ:\tDo we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?\n\tFrom the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had\n\ta number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding\n\twhich approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.\n\nQ:\tDo we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?\n\tWithout a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's\n\tPS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does\n\tleave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be\n\tnice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two\n\tdifferent implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given\n\tan identical set of conditions.\n\nQ:\tPSCRIPT.DRV?\n\tHaving done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of\n\ttesting is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary\n\tsource we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,\n\t(1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,\n\tbut the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe\n\tuses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its\n\twrong.\n\nYes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub\nof Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack\nof design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor\nbecause the vendors don't know what PS is.\n\nDon Newbold\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdon@rastek.com\n"

(And at the moment there\nis only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')\n\n\tFor instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows\n\tchar set in them.

In Windows, for example,\nyou cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a\nfont may very well have them.\n\nANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a\nnew Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow\nyou do this.

Who knows how old 1.15 is.  2.5 is as fast as TT, and if\n> you disable the small screen fonts, ATM does better screen rendering at\n> the smaller point sizes.\n\nNot true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality\nat any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs\nrelated to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason\nfor your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the\nmarket today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font\nvendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being\nhand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted\nTT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.\n\nTrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting\nof diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the\nWindows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can\nbe done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not\njust converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.\n\n> You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time, if you like.\n> ATM (Type 1) fonts tend to be of higher quality\n> and be more complete in terms of foreign characters.\n\nAgain, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone\nconverts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT\nallows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs\nin a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate\nfor the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack\n2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that\nif the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.\n\n\n> Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road\n> Bob Niland                                          Suite 503\n> Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525\n> CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209\n\nHope this clears up some of the confusion.

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\ncheap.  \n\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\n\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\ncircuit would not detect it.   \n\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\nvideo signals to make this work.  \n\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \nsplit supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator\nwith three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply\ncircuit.  \n\nAt this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor\ncircuit.

EDT\n\t     \n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you \nin the thousands of communities around the country that are taking \npart in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.\n\t     \n\t     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas \nJefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to \nmention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he \nhas been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all \nfollowed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education \nhere in this great country.  The success of our democracy according \nto Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational \nsystem.\n\t     \n\t     His philosophy of government, his belief in the \nimportance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest \nhere this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us \nPresident Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in \nthe Chamber of Commerce studios.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for \ntaking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite \nnetwork and we welcome you here this evening.\n\t     \n\t     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  \nAnd, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening \nalso.\n\t     \n\t     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure \nmany of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that \nyou'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In \nWashington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.\n\t     \n\t     I believe the President has a few words that he might \nwant to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that \nat this time.  It's great to have you.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\n\t     \n\t     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob \nReich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the \nChamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, \nalong with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine \ntonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people \nfrom school to the work place.\n\t     \n\t     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, \nrecognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this \neconomy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to \nwork together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to \nmake things happen.\n\t     \n\t     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that \nkind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home \nstate pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart \nCorporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing \nseveral hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I \nappreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all \nthe rest of you.\n\t     \n\t     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward \nconstructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about \nthis being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson \nbelieved in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in \neducation; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and \nthird, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.  \n\t     \n\t     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this \nbeautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful \ncherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change \nwith changing times.\n\t     \n\t     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit \nand increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we \ncan compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --\nabout what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless \nwe do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in \ngovernment, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase \nour investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the \nlong run.\n\t     \n\t     We also have to have people who can carry their load.  \nAnd in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven \nor eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system \nand continues into the work force where education must go on for a \nlifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can \nlearn.\n\t     \n\t     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing \nwe're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \nbetween the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \nprivate sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \ntrying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that \nwould create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many \nthousands that have a strong education component so our young people \ncan be learning and working at the same time.\n\t     \n\t     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good \nplace we can begin, I think, the discussion.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all \ncitizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And \ntonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours \ncan prepare students for this world of work.\n\t     \n\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \nDepartment are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \nSummer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \nThe aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \nproposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \njobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \nareas of the country.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \nsomewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \nfor more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \nwords is that so important?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \nFirst of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \nhave had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \nthem to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \ncontinue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \nresearch that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \nforget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \nover the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \nschools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \ntaught before.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \nnot only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \nabolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \nlearning because we think that the best and most productive workers \nwill have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \ncould maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \nsucceed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \ndisadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \ninto the next year, is really even greater.  \n\t     \n\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \nthroughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \neducational component of training.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \nSecretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \nor for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \neducation is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \nfor example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \ngeometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \nworking on something, and they can see the exact and direct \napplication of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \nlot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \neducation and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \nIt's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \nyoung people even beyond the summer.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n\t     \n\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \nprogram, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \nus a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \ndeveloping.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \nit's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \nwill not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \nrequire some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \nget in a high school diploma.  \n\t     \n\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \nof young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \neducation was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \npeople who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \ngo up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \nthey weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \nemployers.\n\t     \n\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \ntrying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \nbut don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \ntwo years of further training either in a community college, a \nvocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \nthis budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \nfunds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \nand with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \na way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \nbased on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \nrevolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \nthe earnings of American workers.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \nyou know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \npeople watching this program -- that the business community and \neducators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \nof our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \nfact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \npeople watching this program probably are the ones who are most \ndirectly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \nand I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \nalready out there.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \nabout youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \ncareer academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \nwith this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \nthese school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \nyou and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \nlonger than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \ncommunity is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \ndoing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \nChamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \nkinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \naimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n\t     \n\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \nin developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \nhelping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \ndevelop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n\t     \n\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \none of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \nplayers in a community come together and work together and cooperate \ntogether.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \nthe business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \nis talking, but they're not really working together in a common \nstrategy.\n\t     \n\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \nwould be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \nexcellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \ntracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \nmake it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \neligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \ncollege, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \ntalking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \nskills for on-the-job learning.\n\t     \n\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \nalready being done.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \npoint based on my personal experience at home -- the business \ncommunity has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \nthe job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \nbut also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \nof partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \ngoing to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \nsecond-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \ninfluence them.  So I think that's very important.\n\t     \n\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \nthe federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \nfunds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \nsure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \nquality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \ndetermine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \ncourse, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \nprogram for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \nlong-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \nPresident, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \ncommunities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \ncoming forth before too long.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \nwere both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \nschools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \na lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n\t     \n\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \nthat the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \nBush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \ndo this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \nCongress that will actually define the things that the national \ngovernment ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \nchildren of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \ngoals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \nready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \ngraduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \nconfident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \nsecond to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \ndisciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \nthem out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \nlife-long learning in this country.\n\t     \n\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \nstate role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \nrole.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \nintroduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \nand then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \nis and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \nthat we need to meet.\n\t     \n\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \nlike it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \nNot mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \nmoney, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \npartnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \nit will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \nof its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \nsupport and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \nefforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \nthe telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \ncourse, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \nI wonder if you would comment on that.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \nour young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \ndon't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \nof community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \nnational skill standards to which they could aspire and which \nemployers would understand as a national credential, many of these \nyoung people would actually find that they were much more eligible \nfor jobs.\n\t     \n\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \ncountries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \ncollege, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \ntechnical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \nyou don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \ndevelop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \nwith the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \nindustry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \nkinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \ninstitutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \nahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \nTodd of Austin, Texas.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \nRiley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \nhave some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \nhave heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \nsimply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \nmuch of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \nvery supportive.  \n\t     \n\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \nsummer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \nhave over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \nas 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n\t     \n\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \nanswered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \nthe question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \nwould be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \nis even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \nlevel might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\nround basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \nlocal community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \nsomething that we believe is very important to success in this \neffort.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \nanswer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \nand thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \nI've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n\t     \n\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \nstructure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \nprogram and that will move a lot of these young people back into \nschools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \nthe private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \ntry to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \nto be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \nworking on that.\n\t     \n\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \nCongress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \nbuild in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \ntraining programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \nheavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \nasked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \nhope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \ntrained on a year-round basis.\n\t     \n\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \na moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \nas work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \nactually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \nthey're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \nhope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \nwe hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \ncuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \nraisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \nable to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n\t     \n\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \nof my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \nand that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \nschool for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \naddition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \njobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \nIt's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \neconomy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \nelse.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \nthink this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \nthink is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \ngreater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \nto be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \nright, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \nwill be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \nnext year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \nwill be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \ntogether to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \nthen the state, with all the various school districts, a very \nimportant part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \nthink everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \nmoving.\n\t     \n\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n\t     \n\t     Doctor?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \nbe on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \nand work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \nits inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \nalternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \nwe have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \nextremely effective learning strategy.\n\t     \n\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \nseveral principles that are very important in bridging the school and \nwork.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with \npractice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure \nto careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect \nupon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and \nlastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the \ndevelopment of high performance competencies.  \n\t     \n\t     My question, then is:  How can the general education \nfaculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with \ntransition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies \ncan you suggest to achieve this integration?\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- \nand we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting \nwork going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next \nguests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   \nin that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to \nthem and we can discuss it later.\n\t     \n\t     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one \nthing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as \nclear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the \npeople who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more \nexplicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics \nis very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish \nwhat I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is \nvocational learning and what is academic learning.\n\t     \n\t     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think \nwe should have a strong component for people who are in the \nvocational program.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to \nrethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and \nwork combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're \nimportant for all students.  It's not just a special group of \nstudents that needs them.\n\t     \n\t     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United \nStates -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream \nexperiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and \n12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience \nand then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on \nto college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they \ncan go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and \ncareer directions.\n\t     \n\t     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often \ngoes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-\nrelated work within the classroom, within our schools.\n\t     \n\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's \ngoing to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I \nthink you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank \nyou and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and \nyour ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.  \n\n                                 END9:00 P.M. EDT\n\n\n\n"

Tough talk is done by both sides.\nWhen an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk,\nI think.

This is up to each province.\n   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form\n   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  \n   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these\n   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will\n   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess\n   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.\n4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will\n   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations\n   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some \n   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.\n   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)\n\nThis covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory,\ndo not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV.\n\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Keith P. de Solla, P.Eng |  IPSC Ontario, OHA, NFA, SFC, OFAH   |\n| keith@orion.ic.cmc.ca    |  Frontenac Rifle and Pistol Club     |\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow.

I would\ntend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be\nwary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard.\nIe: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane.\nSome people don\'t like these configurations. The second thing is that\nwhoever set up my computer at the factory didn\'t really know what they were\ndoing. The installed windows video driver didn\'t even take advantage of the\nSVGA card/Monitor. Look forward to configuring the system optimally\nyourself.\n\n-- \n=============================================================================\n| "Anyone have a coat hanger?

My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant\ncomparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:\n\n  25 MHz 68040\n  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower\n      than Q 950 style machines for sure).\n  Ethertalk card on-board\n  Audio in/out\n  4 MB RAM on motherboard\n  4 SIMM slots\n  2 NuBus slots.\n  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.\n\nIn comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you\n  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.\n  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I\n  think it ends up costing more.\n\nGreg Dudek\n"

I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor\nvideo card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am\nrunning Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping\nthe program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure\nis very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,\nvery slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.\n\nThe HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it\ndoes not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this\nslow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there\nsomething else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?\n\nThanks.\n\n(You can mail to me directly if you wish, at genek@cs.ucsb.edu).\n'

The\nproblem is as follows:\n\nIf I use any Windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64K-colour driver (ie\n16 colour or 256 colour), the image on screen becomes too tall - no amount of\nresizing on the monitor will make it fit.  And if I use Excel with the 64K-\ncolour driver, it hangs as soon as it loads.  Anyone out there used this\ncard/experienced anything similar.\n\nPlease reply by mail, and I will post any solutions here.\n\nRegards\n\n  - Simon\n\n\n--\n\n\n+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n|  Simon Bernstein              |    "Man is condemned to be free" (Sartre)  |\n|  University of Natal, Durban  +--------------------------------------------+\n|  bernstei@shrike.und.ac.za    |              Simonfish on IRC              |\n+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+\n'

I am in\nthe process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I\nfound two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the\nsame price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that\'s\nthe brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron\n(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB\nmotherboard.\n\nI said that this might be a silly question since I believe that\nMicronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never\nheard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because\nmy impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines\nand they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better\nwarrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have\nrecently aquired Edge Technologies and I\'m not sure how much I should\ntrust the company.\n\nI would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the\nclear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about\neither company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I\ngo with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.\n\nThanks very much in advance for any information.\n\n--\nMohammad Al-Ansari\n'

I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you\nhow to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First\nuse the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions. \nNext, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions\nand specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken\nwill/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you\ndo is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be\nentered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will\nremind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have\nthree transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month,\nmiddle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.\n\nMike\n"

I read an\nold report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the\nexternal monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-\nback.

At the moment I am leaning towards\nthe Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)\nbut are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn\'t the\nmonitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?\n\nPlease send me e-mail and I\'ll summarize.\n\nI would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order\ncompanys that sell monitors or cards.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nEggert Thorlacius\nUniversity of Iceland\n'

They\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before "the night of the\nlong knives". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\nescapes me at the moment) called "Homosexuals in History" asserts that Roehm\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\'s SA circle.\n\n>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,\n>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and\n>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. \n\nWell, you\'re the one who is in Germany. If you don\'t believe the history books,\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the "knight of the\nlong knives" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\'s\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\'ve \nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \n\n>(Irving, a\n>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance\n>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)\n\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\'t you think they \nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \n\n>I challenge anyone to document this claim.\n\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\n\n>I *have* found a great\n>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the\n>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,\n>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.\n\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\n\nI don\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\'s friends\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\'s homosexuality.\n\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality.\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\n\nNo, I don\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\'t have the time. Nothing is\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.\n                                                                           \n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\nDavid Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)\n"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softly\nof us in days hereafter..."

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

Remember from stellar evolution that \nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\nthey don\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\'s) will be in the plane of the\ngalaxy.  \n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\nsuppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\ndisk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\'s an \nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\'t work, also.  As I\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\nthese characteristics.  \n        \n        I think that\'s all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows\nsomething that I don\'t know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of\ntaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\ndistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,\nblack holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It\'s a fun\nfield. \n        Complaints and corrections to: belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu or \npost here.  \n                                                        -jeremy\n\n        \n'

The \nsatellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section \nhoused the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof \nmass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The \nproof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation \npressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered \naround the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.\n\n     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The \n2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a \nsingle-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be \npowered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).\n\n     Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in "Spacecraft Design \nInnovations in the APL Space Department," Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, \nVol. 13, No. 1 (1992).\n\n                                                      --Eric Hoffman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

Drag free may already have\nbeen flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would\nmore accurately respond to motions from the Earth\'s gravity field and\nignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball\nfloating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little\nadjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would\nthen be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity\nanisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously\nadjusting its position to compensate for drag.\n\n\nJoseph Cain\t\tcain@geomag.gly.fsu.edu   \ncain@fsu.bitnet\t\tscri::cain\n(904) 644-4014\t\tFAX (904) 644-4214 or -0098\n'

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\n   highest court "Supreme Court," "Supreme Judicial Court" or "Supreme\n   Court of Appeals," Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\n   "Court of Appeals."  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\n   _second-highest_ court the "Supreme Court, Appellate Division"...\n\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\n\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\'s\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\'s acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it\'s done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you\'ve presented the case... you say that\n"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\'t allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages."  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.")\n\nHow do you define as "blackmail" one party\'s act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn\'t, or at least shouldn\'t be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation."\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\'t want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: "Everyone\'s property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole."\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as "infamous?"  That\'s really sad if\n> it is, because I fail to see how it\'s less than completely sensible.\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don\'t like it, for whatever\n> inexplicable reasons.\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call "economic correctness" over justice.\n\n(2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\'s wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people\'s property by eminent domain.)\n\n> You\'d like Posner, Bill.

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

You might notice that\nmany of the natives have wads in their mouths... the tea can be obtained in S.\nAmerican pharmacies. This remedy alleviates some of the lightheadedness and\ndizziness - but don't try to jog with it. I've tried this when travelling and\nhiking in Peru and Ecuador. The amount of cocaine you would ingest are too minute\nto cause any highs...\n\nAlso it is a good idea to eat lightly and dress warm while adjusting to high altitudes.\n\n\n"

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\nvia netmail...)\n\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. "Argumentum\nad silence-your-opponent-um"?! I would have thought he would have\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\n\nThe issue that seems to be: "Is the following an advertisement?"\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\n\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \n\t*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\n\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\n\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\n\thad posted the address and subscription price of "Newsweek",\n\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\n\t"proof" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\n\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\n\tbehold, "poof", there goes my account. This one had an\n\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\n\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\n"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they\nonly get "I don\'t like what that user is doing because...".\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\n\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "Thanks for\nthe info" or "Could you send me such and such?" or "Your posts are\nvery interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "Go aways". But,\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock..."My name is Ted and\nand this is Mark... We\'re from the thought police. Seems you have\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we\'re here to confiscate them...")\nNWO Indeed!\n\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that\'s all folks!\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\nwas just getting started.\n\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank\'s motivations for getting me axed?\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\non the net that are of "interest" to the government, and Ted sure seems\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he "attends"(?) is well\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\n\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \n\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \ndiseases via this route...so it\'s good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \nbeing poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and            \nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any \'cooties\' that \nhaven\'t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body\'s exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I\'m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \n\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu\n                                                                                                    \n  \n'

She would touch her head and strands of hair would\njust fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).  \nIt continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the\nsize of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two\nmore bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's\ndescribed include:  several months of an irregular menstrual\ncycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been\nextremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake\nup one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day\nit's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5\nvery bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that\nknocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.\n\nShe went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason\nfor the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected\nthyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything\ncame back normal.  \n\nShe's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any\nideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should\nsee an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?\n\n** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently\ntaken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't\nrecently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm, \ncoloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall\nout.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\n\n\n\n"

Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence\n worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is\n the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by\n soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-\n antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and\n grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.\n\nWorship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.\n\nHundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman\n Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of\n Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship\n was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership\n in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in\n ancient times is fascinating!\n\nOh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.\n\nI am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the\n Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels\n of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns\n in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure\n that they had Mithraic significance or not.\n\nI don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the\n Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.\n\nSomeone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More\n likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed\n by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all\n throughout even up to France bigtime.\n-------\nCHARLES HOPE   A54SI@CUNYVM   A54SI@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU\nGOVERNMENT BY REPORTERS...MEDIA-OCRACY.\n"

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

OldPos 2 | 5 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.\nWhat declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent\nincrease_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit \n(2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.\nBrett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit\ndeclined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps\ngrowing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed\npreviously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your\nincome exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.\n\nFiggie\'s book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each\npresident, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.\nReagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.\n\nAs a really rigorous aside to this thread.....\n\nDuring pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an\n"economist" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive\nand based largely on population data. I don\'t know his name, but his\narguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know\nwith common sense -- the boom of the 80\'s has nothing to do with government\npolicy, particularly "supply side" policy, since taxes do not "cause" \neconomic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be \nexplained by watching population waves roll through the years and \ncreate cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into\nthe middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he\nis.\n\nPaul Collacchi\n'

If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that\nyesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be\nreading this was there for it and remembers that it happened.\nBut *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere.\nYou need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that\nyou remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything\nyou clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you\nhallucinated the whole thing.\n\nTo talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the\nterms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the\nresurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.\n\nI think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is\never disproved. I also think that this will not happen, as\nthe evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things\ngo. It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take\nthe resurrection on faith. There are reasons to believe it\nthat appeal to the mind, too.\n'

They manage to make it up on other charges.\n\nOnce again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney\ndialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services\nto a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.\nOtherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the\nvast expansion that has occurred.\n\n>\n>> Remember, the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but\n>> make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market. :) \n>\n>Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an\n>array of products at prices below cost?  Are not grocery stores\n>embedded in a relatively free market?\n\nCan you spell "loss leader?"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not\nattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of\nit.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader \nfor other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  \n\nBut the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\n\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \n\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\nresults for both providers and consumers.  Claims that "government\nbureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace\nshould take such such cases into account.\n\njsh\n\n>\n>=Mark\n--\nSteve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \n"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\n the bulls**t." - R.
