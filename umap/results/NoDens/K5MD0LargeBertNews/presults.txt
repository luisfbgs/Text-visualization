I have\nused Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource\nconverter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially\nthe naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.\nWith windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance,\nthis doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK,\nand Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So \nyour constructor should know how to convert a #define into the\nproper resource identifier.\nI'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does\nuse resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to\nport to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel\nfor anything ) \n\n\n\nAlex.\n\n\n--\n__  __|       \\      __|       Alex Colburn                  \n   |       /   \\    |          Image Analysis Facility      \n   |      _____ \\   __|\t       University of Iowa          \n______| _/      _\\ _|          colburn@tessa.iaf.uiowa.edu  \n"

The three problems I see are:\n\n  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.\n  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.\n  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the\n     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.\n\nBeing more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these\nlimitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff\nfloating around blithely accept what they\'re given?  I could write\nthe server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, \nbut I\'d rather avoid this if not necessary.\n\nI know there are no absolutes, but I\'d appreciate hearing people\'s\nopinions and suggestions.

Windows will use a swap file\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\nthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book\nthey handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended\nswapfile".  I\'ll quote the information\n\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\n  of RAM on your machine.\n\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\ntelling you what little he knew.\n\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren\'t actually\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\nyou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick\nup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.\nThat is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You\ncould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself\nI sprang for Word.\n\nWell, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone\nwill go to a workshop and save a little money.\n\nAnd if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.\nI need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)\n\nThanks,\nBrent Casavant\nbcasavan@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu\n\n'

This particular product\nuses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent\nPC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation\nprocessed PS.\n\nThe quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for\nthe PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.\n\nWe were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was\naccepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts\nthe image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript\nprocessor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is\nresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our\ncamera images came out very good in my opinion.

The problem was not the resurrection\nwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population \n(the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was\nthat Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the\nstate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism \nbecomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this,\nand were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile,\nand hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since\nChristians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is\nseen by Nero\'s blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let\'s not cloud the\nissues with the resurrection.\n\nrandy\n\n[I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically\nbecause they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did\ncause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus.\nOf course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other\nthan a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians\nscholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event --\nin effect, a delusion.  --clh]\n'

There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the \nFuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There\nused to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in\nTexas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.\nControllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses\nthough.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but\nI think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,\nif you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.\nCheers,\nCorwin\n'

The first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of\nCasablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little\ngrainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it\nhad 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.\n\nI consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many \nother formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don\'t know what\nkind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy\nthat showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.

Whenever I save an icon which contains dark\ncolors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the\nbright colors. This happens with every icon editor including the image\neditor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP files\neither; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is with\nthe icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the file\nwith a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing the\ncolormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I can\nfix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem? \n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n--\nSadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nCenter for Reliable and High-performance Computing\ne-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu\n"

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

1 b'From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office \nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 71\n\nI have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\'d GIF images contain charts outlining\none of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in\nCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I\'ll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as \n      the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun\n'

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"
3 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'
4 b"From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)\nSubject: Re: Guns for Space\nKeywords: Sopa Gun, Space Launcer\nOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL\nLines: 72\n\n\nOkay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"

Both spacecraft will team up with\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\n     Japan\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\nwhile within view on Earth.\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\'s project manager for the\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\n     "One of our main activities is developing the methodology\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\ncelestial objects," said Smith.\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\n     "There is a long history of radio astronomy using\nground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is to\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy."\n     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galactic\nnuclei, you\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\nthan you would expect."\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\nthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look further\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\'s\nparticipation in the project.\n     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians have\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\nscience mission.\n     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"\nhe said.\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\nambitious project, JPL\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\n     "Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\nscientifically exciting missions."\n                           ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.\n\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\n'

April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n\t"Basically what we\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."\n\n\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n\t"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n\t"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"\nHeflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives."\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour\'s June flight and Discovery\'s July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.\n\n- end -\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\'s. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\'s minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development."\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\nprovided by the Agency.

You\'re missing a central teaching of Christianity -\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\nwho consider themselves "christians" are (even those who manage to head\ntheir own "churches").

No one can browbeat you\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\nmodern offshoots like the "new age movement" teach or does he require God\'s\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\nsome people it did comprise their life\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you\'ve never read "A Pilgrim\'s\nProgress," I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\n\n>Peace and Love\n>In God(ess)\'s name\n>James Moss\n\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\nwrote that "I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\nof the teachings of christ".  Well, Christ referred to God as "My Father",\nnot "My Mother", and while the "maleness" of God is not the same as the\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\npopulation.\n\nWell, I\'m not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\narticle.

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\nin "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent time\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\'s actual sampling\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\n\nIs the HP scope you\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\n\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\nfall...\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\n\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\n'
17 b"From: bfinnert@chaph.usc.edu (Brian Finnerty)\nSubject: Mary's assumption\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 34\n\nA few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\nearth:\n\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.\n\nBrian Finnerty\n"

McCord)\nSubject: Questions from a newbie\nOrganization: University of Virginia\nLines: 56\n\n\n\tIs life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a\ncurve?\n\tI\'m new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to\nknow what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\nhe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\nAlso, are we "graded" by those around us, or has there always\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person\'s childhood taken\ninto account?\n\tI\'m sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\nmost of you, but I figure that you\'re the experts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-Quinn\n\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\nthat\'s because our primary source of information is prophets and\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\nboth Jesus\' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like "even XXX will be better\noff than you in the judgement."  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\nto the Bible and "Holy Tradition" of a more generic Christian sort.\n\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\nus from the results of a test that we couldn\'t possibly pass.  If you\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it\'s easy to\nsee why you\'d be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\n\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\nhow far God\'s cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don\'t\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\ndescription of how to be saved, but it\'s not clear to me that he\nprovided an exact description of how he\'s going to place the dividing\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can\'t expect to know whether\nother individuals are saved or not.\n\n--clh]\n'

Massive amounts of regolith would\nhave to be processed.\n\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo\'s claims some time ago about the moon\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn\'t\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth\'s crust,\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\n\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; "high-Ti" basalts (Apollo 11\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\nbasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\nmined today).\n\n\tPaul F.

The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and\nmake it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just\nfine.

OldPos 4938 | 8 b"From: Mel_Shear@maccomw.uucp\nSubject: Adapter Cable for VGA Monitors\nLines: 51\n\nDoes anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to\nApple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's\n160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter does\nnot do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into\nthe correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.\n\nDo I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??\n\nThe following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming\nthat the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);\n\n\nMacintosh LC to VGA\n \nThe Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA\nmonitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to\n16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported\nto 256 colors.\n \nNote:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level\n          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work\n          with the Macintosh LC.\n \nTo connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable\nfrom the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the\npinout description for the adapter cable:\n \nMacintosh LC        VGA\nVideo Connector     Pin     Signal Name\n---------------     ----    -----------\n1                   6       Red ground\n2                   1       Red video signal\n5                   2       Green video signal\n6                   7       Green ground\n9                   3       Blue video signal\n13                  8       Blue ground\n15                  13      /HSYNC\n12                  14      /VSYNC\n14                  10      HSYNC ground\n7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together\n \nVGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC\nvideo connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which\nresults in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA\nmonitor.\n\n***************************************************************************\nThis message was created on MCW BBS a jointly supported by\nNew Orleans Mac User Group & National Home & School User Group\nuser@maccomw.uucp        The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.\n***************************************************************************\n"

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down\nfor a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it \nup.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or\njust coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're\npenalized again!\n \nSheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling \nevery little push an shove in a game like that.

If the other players on his line\ncan smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --\nhe's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left \nwing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will\nput some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should\nbe benched.\n \nI hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't\ndo all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we \nneed some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay \nconsidering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin \nmessed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can \neasily do it again.\n \nMy prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins \nwill be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand\nby that.\n \nDon't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to\nwin 3! :-)\n \nBurns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.

That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\'s because the Isles don\'t shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\'s a\ndefenseman.  He\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such "enforcers"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\'s "called for".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of "hockey ethics"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI\'m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn\'t call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don\'t deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,\n\nGary at Hofstra\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET\n'

But that is\nonly for some of the players.

Of course I can\'t say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n"take" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with "winning spirit" and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and "hot".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their "sudden death" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.  They proved it.\n\ncordially, as always,\n\nrm\n\n-- \nRoger Maynard \nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n'

Sure, it\'s been cold, the food lines were long,\nand the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique.\nOr so I thought.\n\nI went to Tuesday\'s game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the \'Stick was \na much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but \neverything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are\nCLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. \n\nThe new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence\nare very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top\nof the fence and give a great view, and they\'ve got beer stands at the\nbottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic \nold-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.\n\nThese things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real \nbusinessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just \nlike he used to tell his checkers, "If the customers don\'t come back, I don\'t\nneed as many checkers". This isn\'t a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent\nbusinessman but he didn\'t deal much with the general public.\n\nI\'ll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion \ndispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized for\nthe problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleaned\nthe machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, there\nwas no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say "Go to\nthe stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help".\n\nAll in all, it was a fun day\n\n\n--\nCraig Eid \ne-mail address    craige@hpsad.sad.hp.com\n'

Bridgman be-\ncame the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a\ncaptain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the\nplayers.

Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible, Steve, and I \n>see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I\'ll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT\'s comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don\'t know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er\'s?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I\'ve\nknown many M.D.\'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don\'t oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor\'s.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let\'s move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \n>no idea how the human body interacts with it\'s environment and how that \n>balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...  Could it just be\n>professional jealousy?  I couldn\'t help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.\n\nYou\'ve helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from \'anal retentivitis\', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n>...Humans have all \n>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small \n>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\'t get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\'s made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered \'systemic\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \n>Elaine\'s doctor a quack.\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\'s one of those \'evil\' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\'m taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\'t\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\'s\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \n>the candida or not isn\'t certain.\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\'s also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of \'ifs\', and \'implies\', which doesn\'t please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n>If it\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \n>nondescript.  \n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the \'yeast hypothesis\' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\'t observe or culture\nthe yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there\'s no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt\'s a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \'yeast hypothesis\' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\'s not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\'m very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\'s case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\'s a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.

While this low level of vitamin \n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nAren\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the  most common cause of \n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.

You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\'ve been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  It\'s like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nAlso, if one is an \'anal retentive\', like I\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.

When I finally find a \n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nAs I\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\'t work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\'s failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\'t plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT\'s I saw who said that I\'d just have to "live with\nit".  I\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT\'s totally floored him when they said "you\'ll just have\nto live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n"yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n"it\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn\'t work.  I\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\n"well, I\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don\'t work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I\'ll have to register your case at the State\nBoard."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\'ve jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\'s doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

A\ncolleague of mine had a child with a serious congenital disease, tuberous\nsclerosis. Along with mental retardation comes a serious seizure disorder.\nThe parents noticed that one thing that would precipitate a seizure was\na meal with corn in it. I have always wondered about the connection, and\nfurther about other dietary ingredients that might precipitate seizures.\nOther experiences would be interesting to hear about from netters.\n\n--\nDavid Ozonoff, MD, MPH\t\t |Boston University School of Public Health\ndozonoff@med-itvax1.bu.edu\t |80 East Concord St., T3C\n(617) 638-4620\t\t\t |Boston, MA 02118 \n"

Hopefully, you won\'t\nget flamed, either.\n\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\n\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an "objective morality". \nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\n\n> Assumptions:\n> \n> (1) A Christian bedrock assumption that all that is True, comes\n> Truly from God. \n> \n> (2) Regarding alt.sex.stories.

If, as you say,\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\nusing the Christian Bible?  You\'re defeating your own purpose by doing so.\n \n> In the long run, the advantage of making such a literary/moral\n> analysis is that it will save band-width between Christians and\n> non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of\n> the stuff on these (pornographic) groups.\n\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won\'t stop the flamage.  There will always\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\noverbearing totalitarianists?\n \n> Basically, there should not be a dissonance between a "Christian"\n> morality and a "non-Christian" one.  Either there is value in a\n> particular work, or there is not whether one is a Christian or\n> not.\n\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\nstart off by saying that I think it\'s immoral to force people to have sex with\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don\'t know your views on\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\nhave their faces uncovered.\n\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \n                                                                         \n> In support for the first assumption:\n> \n> The Christian scriptures say this:\n\n\t(Evidence deleted)\n\nI\'m not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept "The Word\nof God" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for\na person who shares your beliefs.\n\nStill, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could\nbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.\n\n>                                                                        \n>              **************************************\n> \n> NOW THEN what are some of the major themes/motifs in the\n> pornographic literature on places like alt.sex.stories?

In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the "homer" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \'guys\')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\nJets, or St. John\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\nDuring the summer, it\nis all talk on WIP.\n\n\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \n\n\n\n            Rich\n-- \n  "You\'ve read the hat, now see the movie."\n                   -Imus in the morning \n  "A blurb?

(The handwave is intentional)\n\n\tI\'ve worked and published research on rods and cones for over\n10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can "detect color"\nis frustrating.

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and\nOberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a\nspot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,\nthe detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the\nfour sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of\nthe crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional\nto the position of the spot on the detector\'s face.  Let\'s try some ASCII\ngraphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)\n\n\n\n              -------------------------> 1\n             |                       |\n             |                       |       |\\\n           -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\\n           XXXXX                     ________| +  \\\n           XXXXX|                            |      \\        -------\n    light >XXXXX|                            |        \\_____ divider __ output\n           XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------\n           XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |\n           XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2\n           XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /\n           XXXXX|         \\ /        |       |/\n           XXXXX| anode              |\n           XXXXX                     |\n           ----- cathode 2           |\n             |                       |\n             |                       |\n             --------------------------> 2\n\nIf the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position\nof the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-\ntion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When\nthis circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of\n"tuning" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED\nfor an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between\nthe two is the position of the LED.\n\nHamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and\nthey also sell the required signal processing electronics.

During the second  Imlach\nera, when Darryl Sittler was called a "cancer on the team", he tore the\nC off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn\'t have a Captain.\n\nSittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly\ncaptaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler\'s friend) Bobby Clarke.

But that is\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\nrather be playing golf, don\'t really give a damn.  Of course I can\'t say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n"take" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\ngoing to come back with "winning spirit" and all of that crap but these\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and "hot".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their "sudden death" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.

That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\'s because the Isles don\'t shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\'s a\ndefenseman.  He\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such "enforcers"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\'s "called for".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of "hockey ethics"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI\'m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn\'t call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don\'t deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,\n\nGary at Hofstra\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET\n'

One of the cards the local stores are pushing is\nthe Genoa 8500 for $125-140. Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc. chip,\nbut I don't know which one (GD5426?). One of the shops I've spoken with \nclaims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid\nFahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (S3 86C805 based), but that can't be true\nif it is using the GD5426. I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it\nlags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one \nof them.\n\nAny info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. If I get replies via\nemail, I'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBrian Oppy  (bjoppy@ucdavis.edu)\n\n"

I am in\nthe process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I\nfound two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the\nsame price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that\'s\nthe brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron\n(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB\nmotherboard.\n\nI said that this might be a silly question since I believe that\nMicronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never\nheard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because\nmy impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines\nand they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better\nwarrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have\nrecently aquired Edge Technologies and I\'m not sure how much I should\ntrust the company.\n\nI would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the\nclear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about\neither company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I\ngo with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.\n\nThanks very much in advance for any information.\n\n--\nMohammad Al-Ansari\n'

An average\neuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better \nskater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL\nare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL.

The problem is that the car has \naftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\n\nThe inspection garage said that they won\'t pass it unless I get a\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it\'s illegal.  He\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can\'t have tint, if\nyou can\'t see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\nand said "It\'s just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\na ticket for it right now." Well, won\'t argue with that...\n\nSince the vehicle code says it\'s OK as long as you can see through the\ntint, I\'d like to keep it (I\'ll re-read the vehicle code in the\nlibrary).  I\'d also like to get some sort of paper from the police\nthat says it\'s OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won\'t\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn\'t mind registering\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\n\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania?

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

OldPos 4 | 1 b"From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)\nSubject: Re: Guns for Space\nKeywords: Sopa Gun, Space Launcer\nOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL\nLines: 72\n\n\nOkay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"
OldPos 1 | 2 b'From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov\nSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4\nOrganization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office \nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\nLines: 71\n\nI have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode\'d GIF images contain charts outlining\none of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in\nCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station\'s CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\'ve never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\'s life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\'s committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\'s design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I\'ll\nlet you all know when I get that done.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as \n      the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun\n'

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"
OldPos 7 | 4 b'From: jgreen@trumpet.calpoly.edu (James Thomas Green)\nSubject: Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts.\nOrganization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo\nLines: 51\n\nWhy do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For\nexample, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....  \n\nI\'ve heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"\nspacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n"drift" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n\n\n/~~~(-: James T.

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]\n\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\'s idea -- Any Takers?\n'
OldPos 3 | 6 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

It\'s more likely that the Moon will never\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\nmaterials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \nand it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat \nsink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\'s a very minor \nactivity in the global scope of things.\n\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\n\nWe don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\ncenturies, if not much longer.\n\nLuna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again. There\'s little glory in watching from a\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little\nultimate profit either.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n'
OldPos 199 | 8 b"From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)\nSubject: Re: Elevator to the top floor\nOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL\nLines: 56\n\n\nReading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their\nERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive\nstrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\n\nDani Eder\n\n-- \nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\n"

The directive provides for the following:\n\nAdvanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption\nare part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. \nEncryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of\ncommunications and data by preventing unauthorized access. \nAdvanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to\nrapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. \nThese advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the\ninfrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the\ninformation age.\n\nDespite its benefits, new communications technology can also\nfrustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\ninnovative approaches.\n\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\n\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\n\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\nescrow system.\n\nKEY-ESCROW\n\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\ncommunications.\n\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\na final standard within six months of this directive. \n\nThe Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\nthe extent needed to preserve the government\'s ability to conduct\nlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\nlaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\nshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\nSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\n'

PC World,\nDecember 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.\nI can email you copies of these articles if you can\'t find them at your\nlibrary.\n\nI\'ve been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have\nseveral friends who use Quicken, though I\'ve not used it myself.  My\noverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager\nwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your\nfinances.\n\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:\n\n\tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:\n\tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile\n\tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.\n\n\tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that\n\tbudget.\n\n\tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill\n\tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.\n\t\n\tThe ability to print checks on your printer.\n\n\tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.\n\n\tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts\n\tup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically\n\tvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I\'m not sure about it.\n\n\tThe ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation\n\tprograms.\n\n\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that\nQuicken does not:\n\n\tA tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to\n\tpredict your tax liability for the coming year.  It\'s usefull to fine\n\ttune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn\'t get his due too early.\n\n\tAn insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep\n\trecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.\n\tIt can also compute your life expectancy.\n\n\tA financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, \n\teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to\n\tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and\n\tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you \n\tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford\n\ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good\n\tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether\n\ta particular investment\'s cash flow is adequate for your situation.\n\tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping\n\tyour kids with their tuition.  \n\n\tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets\n\tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this \n\tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules\n\tare automatically included here.\n\n\tA "desk" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file\n\tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital\n\tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a\n\trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment\n\tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to\n\ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list\n\tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.\n\nThere are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I\'m almost\nsure that Quicken doesn\'t do everything I\'ve listed.  If I\'m wrong, I\'m sure\nhordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.\n\nOne thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a \nWindows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version\nof Managing Your Money for release late this year.\n\nI hope this information is of use to you.  I\'ve found Managing Your Money to\nbe a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand\nI know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all\nthe features you need or want, I\'d go with it. If you find any of the Managing\nYour Money features that Quicken doesn\'t have to be useful, I think it\'s well\nworth the price.\n'

Again, this is reposted with permission.\n\nTwo requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me\nand others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit\nkey.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such\nthat neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be\nimplemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and\nanother generates the second.  *That* is ominous.\n\nSecond -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they\ncarefully-crafted spook postings.  Don\'t attempt to draw out hidden\nmeanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper).\nLeave Denning out of this; given Hellman\'s record of opposition to DES,\nwhich goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I\ndon\'t think you can impugn his integrity.\n\nOh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren\'t stupid.  If you think\nsomething doesn\'t make sense, it\'s almost certainly because you don\'t\nunderstand their goals.\n\n\t\t--Steve Bellovin\n\n-----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 07:56:39 EDT\nFrom: denning@cs.georgetown.edu (Dorothy Denning)\nSubject: Re:  Clipper Chip\nTo: (a long list of folks)\n\nI was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to\nMarty\'s message:\n\n        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \n\nThe algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports\nall 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling\ncompared with 16 in DES.\n\n\tIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \n\tor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \n\tplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \n\nK is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method\n(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the\nAT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key\nis negotiated using a public-key protocol.\n \n\tencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \n\tand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \n\tmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \n\tproducing\n\n\t     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nMy understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the\n"family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by\nlaw enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I\nwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.\n\n        The unit key \n\twill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \n\tand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \n\nThe unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the\nserial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks\nderived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.\nCompute the 64-bit block \n\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] \n\n(Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with\ntwo keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\n(I\'m unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\nthey\'re called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are\nconcatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and\nthe next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.\n\n\tauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \n\tdecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \n\tthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \n\tmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \n\nMarty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions.\nPlease pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty\'s\ncriteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record\nof being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions\nI\'ve received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,\nLANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.\n\n\tWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \n\tenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \n\tflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \n\tthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \n\tcourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \n\tover which a message will flow.] \n\nMy understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it\nwill be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the\ncommunications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through\nthe decode box, which will have been keyed with K.\n\n\tfor "the wiretap authorizations." When Levy asked for\n\tthe details so he could review the cases as required by\n\tlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\n\tover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\n        comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \n        No single person or authority should have the power to\n        authorize wiretaps\n\nNo single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a mound\nof paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain\nthat includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the\nAttorney General for final approval.\n\nDorothy Denning\n'

Only\nTV could transmit the full sadness of his face. "You say that we\nteach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen\nto a child who sees this ?" And once again he wraps himself in a\nlengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in\nthe field of rubble that was once his home.

This time they hit the largest number of\nhouses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely\ndemolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more\nbrutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the\nresidents were still told to remove their valuables from their\nhomes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the\nhandcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied\nwith some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to\nstand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were\neven allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just\ngold them: Piss and shit in your pants.

I\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\n\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\n\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President\'s new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation."\n\nNASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-\nWest Space Science Center at the University of Maryland\nunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\n\n'

They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.\n\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\n'

The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\nprovided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will\ninclude high-level experts from other European and African\norganisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for\nthe training course are being provided by the United Nations\n\n\n\nTrust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the\nprimary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.\n\nA similar training course is being planned for Latin American\nexperts.\n\n\n"

Simon P. Worden,\n                     The Deputy for Technology, SDIO\n                                    \n                  Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach\n                              April 3,1993\n\n     Most of you, as am I, are "children of the 1960\'s."  We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - "you\'ve lost it!"  The "me" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened\nto your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn\nV\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!\n\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\nAmerican.  Let\'s go fly it!\n'
