I don\'t argue\nthat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I\njust question whether you >should<.\n\nThe fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we\ncan\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I\nreally hope I do, but I\'m not holding my self-similar breath.\n\n> There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal\n> image compression.\n\nUh huh.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  I\'ve been chasing fractal\ncompression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so\ngreat, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t,\nI\'ll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first\n\tencoding devices in the summer, he says.

How do you ensure that the weight of\nthe CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its\nsocket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?\n\n-- \nWill Estes\t\tInternet: westes@netcom.com\n'

It may be\nimpossible to know much about Toricelli\'s thoughts; that\'s too bad if\nit is so.

And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous\nreasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at\na colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).\n\nOf course, Toricelli\'s case may be an example of a rarety: where the\nfantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right\nin the end.\n\nMark\n-- \nMark A.

His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

And a damn good thing to.\nFlights of fantasy just don\'t have much chance of producing anything, at \nleast not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to\nruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with \nfleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project\nthat actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD\'s seem to \nbe particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.  \n\n>(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\n>electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\n>he\'d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\n>genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\n>binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\n>that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\n>Warren\'s fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\n>so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\n>the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\n>much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\n>recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\n>Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\n>Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\nI have to agree with Gary Merrill\'s response to this.  I\'ve read alot of the\nAlu and middle repetitive sequence work and it\'s really very interesting, \ngood work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics.  It\'s \nreally an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting \nresults that were unexpected.\n\nMike\n\n\n'

Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of\nthe\nsheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet\nfrom\nthe sheet feeder, as some do).\n\n(I have no affiliation with GCC, just a satisfied customer.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarl D.

5 b"From: harter5255@iscsvax.uni.edu\nSubject: Help on hand scanners wanted\nOrganization: University of Northern Iowa\nLines: 30\n\nFellow netters,\n\nI'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

The Bible "ends"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God\'s reign end there ? No.\nSo who can say for sure that God\'s messages are either no longer\nhappening or still happening ?\n\nI can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-)\nWith the cold response I\'ve gotten from the past from this\ngroup, it\'s very hard to get the point across. I\'ll only\ngo over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look\nat documents stored somewhere. I\'ve cited the uncorrupted\nbodies of saints before. They\'re still there. 8-)\nThe apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle\nspecifically granted to show God\'s existence. That was\nthe spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several\ncountries. That event is "approved" by the Pope. Currently,\nimages of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa\nare showing tears (natural or blood).

You can be of any religion.\nIf you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned.\nThese are not "members only" events. God and Mary invites \neverybody.\n\nSo in conclusion (finally) ...\nWe RC\'s believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary.\nWe are scared to death sometimes although we\'re told not to.\nThere are more proofs and events.

We have biblical accounts of\nboth his mother\'s ancestry and his father\'s, both tracing back\nto David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus\nwas Semitic.\n\tAs an interesting aside, Jesus\' being semitic makes him\nneither "white" nor "black," and in some sense underscores the\npoint made earlier that his color was not important, it was his\nmessage, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate\non.\n\tFinally, I would direct anyone interested in African\ninvolvement in the church to the account of the conversion of\nthe Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it\'s chapter\n9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.

However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,\nvery slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.\n\nThe HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it\ndoes not have an accelerator chip on it.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the\nWindows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit\nmodes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.  Any feedback will be appreciated.\n\nThe system configuration is:\n\nGateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus\n16 Megs Ram\nSCSI HD & CD-ROM\nUltrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller\nATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM\nDOS 6.0\nWindows 3.1\nMach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)\n\nThanks in advance.\n-- \nAli R.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.

Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

2 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Don Gisburne represents Air Force\n  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for\n  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were\n  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria\n  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the\n  cafeteria.\n  \n  Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the\n  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the\n  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude\n  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational\n  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social\n  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available\n  either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything\n  needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.\n  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-\n  7302."\n  \nBy the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is\nit an advertisement to buy the product.

I have everything under control, I think, besides the\nbatteries.

I've never heard\nanyone discussing this idea, so maybe there's some reason why it isn't\nso great. But maybe someone can tell me.\n\nWould it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries, drain the\nelectrolyte into separate containers (one for each battery), seal the\ncontainer, close up the batteries, and leave them that way? Then it\nwould seem that when the bikes come out of storage, I could put the\nelectrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully\ncharged. What's wrong with this?\n\nOn a related, but different note for you Bay Area Denizens, wasn't\nthere someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back? Who was\nit?

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?  This column\'s already full?  And I still have bunches of \ncommercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start \nof this, column there\'s been a lot of interesting happenings - but \nI\'ll have to put them into the next issue.  \n   Looking ahead, I\'ve got several articles in the works on new \nhappenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market, \nmore news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on \nthe market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other \ninteresting developments. \n   And as always, I hope you folks find this stuff useful and \ninteresting -- Any and all comments are welcome. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nWales Larrison                          Space Technology Investor  \n"Felicitas multos habet amicos"             P.O.

In other\nwords, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,\nnavigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. \nYou wouldn\'t want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I\'d hate to see\nfolks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch\nsystem comes on line.\n\nI guess I\'d simplify this to say that \'waste\' is a slippery concept.

17 b"From: szabo@techbook.com (Nick Szabo)\nSubject: SSF Redesign: Constellation\nSummary: decentralize & automate functions\nKeywords: space station, constellation\nArticle-I.D.: techbook.C51z6E.CL1\nOrganization: TECHbooks --- Public Access UNIX --- (503) 220-0636\nLines: 89\n\nSSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

I was just wondering if we could have some kind\n>of update on DC-X.\n\nWell it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting\nready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out\nof town (in NM).\n\nAs for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work\non SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have\nsome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital\nprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for\nanother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with\nmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a\nset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.\n\nBetter news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of\nthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next\nyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.\n\nNow not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made\nfor spending half on DC.\n\nPublic support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I\'ll\nhelp you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media\nans get them to cover the flight tests.\n\n   Allen\n-- \n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Lady Astor:   "Sir, if you were my husband I would poison your coffee!"   |\n| W.

I\'m >philosophically< opposed to it\nbecause of its complexity.\n\nThis complexity has led to some programs\' poor TIFF writers making\nsome very bizarre files, other programs\' inability to load TIFF\nimages (though they\'ll save them, of course), and a general\ninability to interchange images between different environments\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\n\nAs the saying goes, "It\'s not me I\'m worried about- it\'s all the\n>other<  assholes out there!"  I\'ve had big trouble with misuse and\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\n\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\nemphasis mine):\n\n"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\nand that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\nimage-generating applications out there now."\n\n\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can\'t read >every< TIFF\nimage, that means there are some it won\'t- some that I might have to\ndeal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I\ndon\'t and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not\nthat anyone does, of course! :-)\n\nab\n'

OldPos 7998 | 16 b'From: f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\nSubject: Disappointed by La Cie\nOrganization: Univ of Miami IR\nLines: 52\n\nApproximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for\n$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\'ve called La Cie again and they\'ve given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\'t see\nthe drive there\'s a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\'ll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\'t mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\na letter to La Cie\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\'t even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat\'s the moral of this story? I\'m not sure. But I do know I won\'t buy any\nother products from La Cie in the future.\n\nBill Krauthammer\nf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\n\nPS Please don\'t email or post about how good your La Cie product and service\nhas been. I\'m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like\nthat. All I\'m saying is that I\'ve had a disappointing experience with them and\nI\'ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.\n\n'

Some are gems, some are mundane.\n \n \nMinolta AF 50/1.7 lens for Maxxum cameras.  New lens, but I guess it\'d\nbe best to call it a "demo" since I did not get the literature, box or\nwarranty cards.  $30.\n \nVivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses.  Pretty cute "flip back"\ntang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies.\nIt will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15.\n \nPentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it\'s a Super-Takumar which\nis what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hard\ncase for this lens $5 more..\n \nAlpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine\noptics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with\nstrap can be added..call it $7 more.\n \nVivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285\neclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.\n$30.\n \nUniversal "Roamer 63" folding old "bellows" camera with leather case.\nUses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter\nrelease.  Decent shape.  $20.\n \nWeston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a\ngood cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap.\n \nAnd finally..the "gems"\n \nPentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little\n(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,\nbut try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with\nsplit image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.\n \nOlympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm\nlens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I\nthink this was the predecessor to the XA - and it\'s nearly all metal.\nI won\'t mind holding onto this one if it doesn\'t sell.  $60.\n \nOlympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and\nTokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to\nmint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film\nadvance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact,\nand sharp lens.  $225 for the set.\n \n \nThat\'ll do to clean out some of the stuff.  Feel free to offer on this\nstuff, although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in\nshipping it..\n \nFor more details call or email.\n \n-- \nAlan L.

But we know\nenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.\nThere are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over\nto begin a turn.\n\n\t1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.\n\n\t2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.\n\n\t3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a\n\ttorque which twists the bike over.\n\nTake an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,\n15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be\nneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each\neffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at\nhigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off\nbugger all, relatively speaking.\n\nBy the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to\nrun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running\ngroup where we could start "counter-footing" arguments and have them\nall falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?\n-- \nChris Malcolm    cam@uk.ac.ed.aifh          +44 (0)31 650 3085\nDepartment of Artificial Intelligence,    Edinburgh University\n5 Forrest Hill, Edinburgh, EH1 2QL, UK                DoD #205\n'

I've seen Gravis\njoysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my\nhand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than\na year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability\nto adjust the tension of the stick.\n\nI recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and\nno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. \nI'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\ndown in features.\n\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\n\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\na Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know\nmuch beyond that.\n-- \n     Will Christie       |    AATCHOO!      | PHILOSOPHY: the principles and \n University of Manitoba  |    Uh-oh...      |  science of thought and reality\n  Winnipeg, MB, Canada   |   I'm leaking    | PHILOSOPHER: someone who thinks\nchrstie@ccu.UManitoba.CA | brain lubricant. |  they're useful to society\n"

See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\'s special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\'t work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can\'t go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\'t tell you all the things I\'ve tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.\n-- \nGary H.

The crucial\nthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren\'t of any use\nunless they make you do some experiments.  I\'ve known a lot of scientists\nwhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won\'t admit\nout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.\n\n(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA\nelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that\nhe\'d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic\ngenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out\nbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren\'s fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,\nWarren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)\n\n>It further at least implicitly advances the position that\n>sciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the\n>context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\n>and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\n>weeded out via the "critical function" of science.\n\nI\'m not sure that it\'s random.  But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,\nyou will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.\nIf you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all\nin mind, you will probably get nowhere.\n\n>(Though why this critical\n>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to\nnon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:\nLysenko, Mirsky\'s opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.\n\n>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\n>subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\n>of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.\n>This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)\n\nI don\'t agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at\nwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the\nculture of science that one keeps one\'s jealousies out of the refereeing\nprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.\n\nAnother point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental\ndesign\'\'.  I\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for\nbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously\nbeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny\nnose, what the hell, it\'s worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage\nwas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.\n\n>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.

In most of this thread, I have\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\nwhat is not. \n\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don\'t like these, choose your\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\ndo this.  \n\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \n\n> If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\n> to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\n> But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.

Let\'s face it: we cannot\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\nclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to\nplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. \n\nRussell\n'

OldPos 135 | 15 b"From: edw@boi.hp.com (Edward Walsh)\nSubject: Guzzi 850-T tires, plus fairing question\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard / Boise, Idaho\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\nLines: 59\n\n\n\n\nI have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

I'd\ndef feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that'd be easier\nleg chewing target for those mongrels.\n\nIf there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite\ncomplaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running\nover it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO\ncompared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the\nground by said dog and dies from a head injury. \n\nAny dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace\nrunning about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate.\n\nGraeme Harrison\n(gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com) DoD#649 \n\n"

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

After you read about\nmy situation, I\'d like your opinion.  Here\'s the scenario:\n\n1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).\n    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both \n    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / \n    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies.\n\n2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible\nsolutions (I\'m sure there are others I haven\'t thought about).  For these \noptions, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees \nany flaws (drive type X won\'t coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking \n(I don\'t know very much about these beasts):\n\n1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.\n    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What\'s a good brand?\n    What do the floppies themselves cost?\n\n\n2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a\n    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any\n    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?\n \n\n3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\n    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)\n\n\n4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha\'s or \n    recommendations for manufacturers?  \n\nI appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.

(Around 5 MB.)\n\nI have a Quadra 950. \nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\n         (using block-mode transfers)\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\n\nLet\'s say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\n\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\n\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \n\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\n        ...\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\n\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho\')\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n--David\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| David Blume            | "I get tired thinking of all the things I  |\n| dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don\'t want to do."  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n'

The \ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\nprinter with the "lp" system using the parallel interface and can print \npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\nand translating the image into postscript.\n\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \nsome assurance that the product will work.\n\n\nHere my questions:\n\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \nparallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?\n\nIs there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the\nlimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on \nthe printer?\n \nThe Big question:\n\nWhere can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?\n\n\n\nPlease email directly to me, I don\'t not read news on a regular basis. \nI will post a summary.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-- \n\tE-mail:\t\tscott@ncifcrf.gov ,Phone #:\t(301) 846-5798\n        Title:  \tSr. Systems Manager/Analyst\n'

However, the "gifted one" can\n>only hear himself speaking in his own language.\n>\n\nThere seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which\nare problematic.  It\'s use as prayer language seems especially troubling\nto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing\nthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is\nGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go\nby the Pentecost use where it\'s an actual language.\n\nMoreover, the phrase "though I speak with the tongues of men and angels"\nused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then\nassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it\nis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.\n\nHmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how\nGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that\nif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one\namongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.\n\nSo why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE\nANOTHER?  It\'s disturbing to think that some people find ways to \njustify jabbering.\n\nBut I\'ll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.\n\nTrouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at\nverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that\nthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright\nfabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post\nseems like a "friend of a friend" thing.  And linguistically, a two\nsyllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.\n\nMuch as many faith healers have trouble proving their "victories" (since\nmost ailments "cured" are just plain unprovable) and modern day\nressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that no\nmodern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.\n'

If the gift\nof tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone,\nno matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the\ngift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to\nhave been written. \n\n\n>Perhaps I would believe the "gifted ones" more if they were\n>glorifying God rather than themselves.

Sure, there are some who want glory\nfor themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those\nwho do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian\nchurch also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all\nwho speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.  \nI would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges \ndo so more often in private prayer than in public.\n\nLink Hudson\n\n[There were apparently those in the early church who claimed that\nat Pentecost the miracle was that the crowd were all given the\nability to understand the Apostles speaking in Greek.  --clh]\n'

While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

OldPos 1031 | 10 b"From: bfinnert@chaph.usc.edu (Brian Finnerty)\nSubject: Mary's assumption\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 34\n\nA few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on\nearth:\n\nOne piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\nthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\nburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.\n\nBrian Finnerty\n"

In that posting\nI made sure I used the word "public".  Public revelation contains\nGod\'s truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained\nin the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private\nrevelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.

If the investigation indicates a likelihood\nthat the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be\napproved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However,\nit is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from\nGod.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most\nwell attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those\nat Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject\nFatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not\nmean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\n\nI do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in\nevaluating an alleged private revelation--it\'s not something I need\nevery day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that\nnothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything\nknown through public revelation\n-------\nMarty Helgesen\nBitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu\n\n"What if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation?"\n'

OldPos 8738 | 19 b'From: halsall@murray.fordham.edu (Paul Halsall)\nSubject: Catholic Liturgy\nReply-To: halsall@murray.fordham.edu\nOrganization: J. Random Misconfigured Site\nLines: 60\n\n\n\tThe problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\nsimply IS holy.\n\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\nmass has become a commercial for God\'s grace rather than the real\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn\'t\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus\' body.\n\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\npriest get up and \'explain\' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\nIt doesn\'t help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize\' is only\nslightly better.\n\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\ndoesn\'t work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\n\nIn NYC I can recommend:\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\n\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \n\tSt. Joseph\'s, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, "clean", largely gay\n\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\n\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\n\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste\', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen\n\nPaul Halsall\nHalsall@murray.fordham.edu\n'

Anyway...)\n\n\tThe basis for our (the catholic church\'s) belief in the assumption of\nMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles \nand all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their\nministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were\npresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of\nthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.\n\n\tHope this helps--I would welcome anyone who has more information to\n\tadd to what I\'ve said.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Mike Walker\n\t\t\t\t\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\n\t\t\t\t\t  (Univ. of Illinois)\n\t\t\t\t\t  ]\n'

So here it comes:\n\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n"current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\ndoesn\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writing\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\nyour screen again.  (It does this last "recopy" operation for its\n"fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\n\n The result of this process is the following:\n  \n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\'t performed.\n\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\n        there was room on the disk.\n\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\n\n\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\ntable? I can\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\nsort a directory listing?\n\n\nWith much thanks to the originator of this article.\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\n |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           |\n +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\n | "Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           |\n |  Will this world ever get better, Can\'t we all just live together       |\n |  I don\'t wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              |\n |  I deserve to have a future..."                                         |\n |                                     -The Good Girls    "Future"         |\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\n\n'

It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a\nfloppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes\nthat file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT\nfrom the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true,\nand has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.\n\nThe only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave\nfiles open unless it\'s actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).\n\n-- \nKevin Martin\nsigma@rahul.net\n"I gotta get me another hat."\n'

Edition 01 Apr 93\n\nThis article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2\nor DOS apps not running under Windows.\n\nOne of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that\ntheir RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost\neveryone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)\ndiscovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept\nan incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry\nerrors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or\nFAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer\nthan with the old 2400bps modem.\n\n\nThere are three reasons for the problem:\n\n1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most\n   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the\n   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high\n   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and\n   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded\n   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can\'t.\n\n2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and\n   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely\n   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you\n   are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a\n   16550". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance\n   about this issue,  you\'ll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the\n   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve\n   my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn\'t even\n   know what a UART was.\n\n3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2\'s do), or if you can upgrade\n   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience\n   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers\n   don\'t take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this\n   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications\n   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem\n   by themselves.\n\nIf you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of\nthe card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid\noverrunning it; however, I wouldn\'t want to bet that the card designers\nwere that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem\ncard.  Some modem cards don\'t even have conventional UARTs, but if they\nare to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.\nUse MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.\n\n\nThe Hardware Situation.\n\nThe UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250\nor Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can\'t replace\nthem).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft\ndiagnostic program \\WINDOWS\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*\nbringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from\naccurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.\n\nThe Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with\nconfigurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to\n460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there\'s no point in\npushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access\ncycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but\nit is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,\nsee National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.\n\nSo, what UART component do you have?\n\nTry to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM\nboard or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can\'t find a socketed component with\nthe numbers "8250" or "16450", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,\nand you won\'t be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE\nyour VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket\nCOM board.\n\nIf you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in\nNs16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several\nsuppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The "N" chip is the normal 40-pin\ndual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550\nchips without the "A" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).\n\nEarly Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those\nof their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various\nIC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states\nsupport for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:\nNational Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552\nChips&Technology:       82C607\nTexas Instruments:      t16c550a\nSilicon Systems:        73M550\nVLSI                    16C550\nTurboCom warns about the pre-"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,\nsays that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70\nsystems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).\n\nIf you DON\'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you\'ll need to buy an after-\nmarket COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you\nmay be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you\'ll need to\neither disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to\nCOM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).\n\nAlthough cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the\nproblem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology\nMCT-AIO+ card from:\n\nJDR Microdevices\n2233 Samaritan Drive\nSan Jose  CA  95124\n(800) 538-5000 voice US\n(408) 559-1200 voice other\n(800) 538-5005 FAX US\n\nThe MCT-AIO+ (and the "+" is important) sells for $89.95.  It is an 8-bit\nISA card providing:\n\nPort Type  Connector  Address and IRQ        Comments\nCOM        DB9M       COM 1,2,3 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket\nCOM        ribbon     COM 2,3,4 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket\nParallel   DB25F      LPT1,2,3  IRQ 5,7\nGame       ribbon\n\nThe kit includes a ribbon cable and DB25F connector for the secondary COM\nport, a ribbon cable/connector for the game port, two bulkhead plates for\nthe ribbon-based connectors and a 9F-to-25F adaptor cable.  Each port can\nbe individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR,\nDCD, and DSR jumpers.\n\nJDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.\n\nI have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards\nwith 16550s:\n\nTSD Systems\n(407) 331-9130\n$19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.\n\nGreenfield Trading and Distributors\n(518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX).\nTheir card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.\n\nR&S DATA SYSTEMS, INC.\n820 East Highway 434\nLongwood, FL  32750\nPHONE: (407) 331-1424\nFAX: (407) 331-8606\n2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39\n\nI have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports,\nand am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based\n8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set\nthe internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.\n\n\nThe Software Situation\n\nSimply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun\nproblems.  The standard MS serial drivers don\'t take full advantage of the\n16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1\ndrivers have the following limitations:\n - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.\n - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt\n   rate of 10x during uploads.\n - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it\'s easy for 2\n   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).\n - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.\n   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1\n   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would\n   be effective.\n - The API won\'t accept rates above "CBR_128000".\n - The API won\'t let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even\n   if it did, DOS programs that aren\'t 16550-aware get little benefit\n   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.\n - They don\'t allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.\n - The BIOS doesn\'t initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.\n - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don\'t provide port\n   speed options above 19200 bps.\n\nThese problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may\nor may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).\nRumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "4.0".\n\nYou can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying\na copy of "TurboCom", current version 1.2, from:\n\nBio-Engineering Research\nPacific CommWare Division\n180 Beacon Hill Lane\nAshland  OR   97520-9701\n(503) 482-2744 voice\n(503) 482-2627 FAX\n(503) 482-2633 BBS\nMCImail:    344-5374\nCompuServe: 71521,760\n\nPrice was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit\ncards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom\nbut as far as I know, they don\'t stock it.  Bio is not a software company\nper se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for\nan in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a\nmarket for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They\nrecently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.\n\nI now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my\ndatacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely\nsee transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps\nwhen linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.\nUploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts\nare still using antique UARTs and drivers.\n\nNote that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu\nin Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets\naround this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will\nset the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the\nWindows APIs and dialog boxes.\n\nI also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you\ndo the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is\nnot a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)\nstandard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another\n16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving\nsystem or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough\nto let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm\nengineer has informed me that the 16550\'s can\'t really do CTS/RTS all\nby itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above\n115,200 may still be risky.\n\nEven with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still\nexperience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and\nserious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to\nbuy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a\n16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of\nTurboCom, can be found in the Feb\'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine.\nI suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with\nprocess priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose\nthrashing system still runs into comm problems.\n\n\nClosing Soapbox Comments\n\nThe state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across\nthe computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,\nthe job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be\nassigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer\ncompanies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years\nbehind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation\nvendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the\ninitial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was\nsubsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the\nexception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent\nI/O.\n\nYou may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this\nsituation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect\ncries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs "sort of"\nwork today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a\nhardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that\nuse that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.\n\nRegards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road\nBob Niland                                        Suite 503\nInternet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525\nCompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209\n\n                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods\nare responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject\nboundaries...\n                                                                       \n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\nDavid Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)\n"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softly\nof us in days hereafter..."

I have just been informed of what I feel is\none of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The \nout-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people\ndon\'t like what he says or thinks.\n\nWe have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have\nnot agreed with their content, I\'m sure most of us have been at least\nsomewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought)\nin a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please.\nIf I don\'t wan\'t to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But,\nunfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel\nan overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that\nMr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif\nnet police, Ted Frank.\n\n\nPLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE. \n\n                      ARE YOU ON TED\'S HIT LIST?  \n                      ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?  \n                        IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?\n         HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?\n\nI thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!\n\n \nPlease read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that \nyou may understand this vial act for what it is...\n\n------------------------------ forwarded ---------------------------------\n\nNewsgroups: alt.activism,alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc,misc.legal\nSubject: Officer Ted Frank, Thought Police Badge Number NWO-666\nSummary: Ted wins the argument by killing his opponent!\nExpires: \nDistribution: \nOrganization: University of Colorado, Boulder\nKeywords: NWO Ted Frank\n\nWell, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\nvia netmail...)\n\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. "Argumentum\nad silence-your-opponent-um"?! I would have thought he would have\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\n\nThe issue that seems to be: "Is the following an advertisement?"\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\n\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \n\t*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\n\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\n\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\n\thad posted the address and subscription price of "Newsweek",\n\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\n\t"proof" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\n\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\n\tbehold, "poof", there goes my account. This one had an\n\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\n\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\n"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they\nonly get "I don\'t like what that user is doing because...".\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\n\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "Thanks for\nthe info" or "Could you send me such and such?" or "Your posts are\nvery interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "Go aways". But,\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock..."My name is Ted and\nand this is Mark... We\'re from the thought police. Seems you have\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we\'re here to confiscate them...")\nNWO Indeed!\n\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\na new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.\nI will be on for a few more days and then... that\'s all folks!\nYour comments and support are requested. I can no longer post\nto news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\nwas just getting started.\n\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank\'s motivations for getting me axed?\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\non the net that are of "interest" to the government, and Ted sure seems\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\nhe work for? The University of Chicago which he "attends"(?) is well\nknown as one of the biggest NWO supporters...\n\nAnd finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here\nin the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the\nprocess of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe\na TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Since I\nam longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY\nsoon, I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:\n\n\tA. J.

Taking\nanything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea\nof taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,\nadditional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are\nnot known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that\nin a given situation the risk is worthwhile.\n   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in\nsome cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn\'t been in use\nthat long, and it really isn\'t clear what if any effects it may have\nwhen taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested\nby present day standards.

I am not\n        convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_\n\tinformation, since in any case requiring disclosure, there\'s\n      \tlikely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly\n \t*wrongful* disclosure.\n\n\t- GAO: perhaps.

I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is\nessentially a group of auditors: they audit how people\'s civil\nliberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\ninvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\nreason.\n\nWhen I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\nauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\nsecurity point of view, but wouldn\'t tell us how to fix it.  I always\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\nthe problem.\n\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\nAuditors don\'t like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\nauditee can say, "Well, you told us this way would be OK."  It\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor\'s\njob.\n\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU\'s part, a key half gets\naway that shouldn\'t, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\nliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\nBut they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\nand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\n\nThere are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\nplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\nautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\nwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\nwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\n\nI believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\nsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\nchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\ntoday, he better be able to produce yesterday\'s checks so that they can\nbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\nlegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\nput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\nconflict of interest.\n\nAs always, my opinions are my own.\n\nLynn Grant\nGrant@Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL\n'

This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any \'cooties\' that \nhaven\'t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body\'s exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I\'m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \n\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu\n                                                                                                    \n  \n'

Obviously, it\nis no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published\ndocuments to find material to use against Israel makes it so.  \n\n   Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising\nin itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was\ncurious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind\nhis phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some\ntypical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  Is\nhe some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it\nthere, and is now taking his failure out on Israel?  \n\n   Let's shed some light on this clown once and for all.  It will\nhelp put his nonsense in the proper perspective.  And the readers\nof this group who are more interested in fact than in anti-Israel\nhyperbola can ignore this junk.\n\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

I don\'t know what the launch vehicle\nwould be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --\ncertainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA\nfor, e.g.,  launch support would probably \ncover NASA\'s incremental costs pretty well.\n\n>>This\n>>may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of\n>>Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the\n>>project is to help the environment!

I\'m sure folks around here would like to \nsee a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, \nthe U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure\nwould not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was\n(or a parade balloon, for that matter).\n>\n>>..........\n>>What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize\n>>the night sky?

OldPos 2 | 9 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n'

Yes, I understand the issues.  I don\'t even\nparticularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the\nsort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?

Sounds like it\nwould have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly\nlow orbit.\n\n\t2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?\nWhat real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical\nastronomers are *really* going to be impacted?\n\n\t3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of\n\'seeing\' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the\nsensors are supposed to return along with the data for large\ninflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?\nThe choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is\nbeing used to help fund this thing.\n\n\t4) If your answer to 3) above was "the astronomers", then feel\nfree to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more\nimportant research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING\nANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

But yes, you've got the idea -- the\nreboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.\n\n>My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost?\n>why not  grapple,  do all said fixes,   bolt a small  liquid  fueled\n>thruster module  to  HST,   then let it make the re-boost...\n\nSomebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf\nitem.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include\nattitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things\nlike thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro\ndata from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you\ndon't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible\ncontamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get\nto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is\ndone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for\nthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from\nthrusters and the like).\n\nThe original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the\nreboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well\nsuited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing\na lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was\nrelatively short, so it got cancelled.\n-- \nSVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\nbetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"

(These measurements are statistical, and you can\nalways hide a sufficiently small number of a different\ntype of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming\nthat there is only one population of GRBs).\n\nThe data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center\nof the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center\nof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets\nway beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing\nGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to\nbe released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models\ntend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.\n\nIf GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)\nyou would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of\nthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center\n(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they\nare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in\nradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda\nGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the\nEarth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.\n\n>my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering\n>hyperspace :-)\n\nThe aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't\nsee many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.\n\n>but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\n>are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\n>if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\n\nThere are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.\nRight now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium\non new models until new observational evidence comes in.\n\n-- \n\t\tDavid M.

Where are they? \nFrom: belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu\nOrganization: Mankato State University\nNntp-Posting-Host: vax1.mankato.msus.edu\nLines: 67\n\nIn article <1radsr$att@access.digex.net>, prb@access.digex.com (Pat) writes:\n>   What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?\n> \n> Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are\n> quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?\n> \n> Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   \n> \n> my own pet theory is that it\'s  Flying saucers  entering\n> hyperspace :-)\n> \n> but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they\n> are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered\n> if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.\n> \n> pat  \n        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no\nnotes so I\'ll try to wing it...  \n        Here\'s how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that \nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\nthey don\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\'s) will be in the plane of the\ngalaxy.  \n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\nsuppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\ndisk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\'s an \nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\'t work, also.  As I\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\nthese characteristics.  \n        \n        I think that\'s all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows\nsomething that I don\'t know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of\ntaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\ndistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,\nblack holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It\'s a fun\nfield. \n        Complaints and corrections to: belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu or \npost here.  \n                                                        -jeremy\n\n        \n'
