The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:\n\nA/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to\n200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed\ninputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the\nsame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate\nmust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits\nat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national\nInstruments, at the same sample rate.\n\nD/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of\nthe 4 output channels has its own converter.\n\nThe price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface\nboard (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP\'s is $2695.

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor\nhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the\ncurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing\nand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,\nthis resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the\nstrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  \nOr use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get\none.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these\ndraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.\n\nWhat you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light \nat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current \nfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing \nboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a \nlow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow \nat reduced brightness. \n\nBe sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires \nin a safe manner!\n"

If you don't want to hear\nthe transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator\nis the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,\nTHEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.\n\n\tIt used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors\nin switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few\nthousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which\ndrives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices\nare cheaper than relays.\n\n\tJohn Whitmore\n"

I\'d be interested in the cost per megabyte and the\n>approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.\n\nI think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence\nthat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for\nWarren\'s fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in\nso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into\nthe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were\nmuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was\nrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.\nOther species have different sets of transposons.

But there is no known rational mechanism\nfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.

If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)\'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can\'t allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

There are three wires to control how you want turbo\nto become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think\nthe middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire\nconnects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two\nwires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate\ntwo wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.\n\nLED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which\nway the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,\nif the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the\nboard, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard\nis like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't\nlight, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the\nlab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it\n(as long as my advisor doesn\'t catch me - which is easy enough to do), but \nstamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review \ncommittees and the peer review process in general.

And a damn good thing to.\nFlights of fantasy just don\'t have much chance of producing anything, at \nleast not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student to\nruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with \nfleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project\nthat actually has a good chance of producing some results.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers\nto look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was\nmint.\n\n   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k\nmiles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.\nThere is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.\nI've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all\nsaid low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.\n\n   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain\nit at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my\nVFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.\nProgressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.\n\nGood luck,\n\n _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________\n|                                                              |\n| Ken Snyder              ms/loc: 330 / UN2                    |\n| Hewlett-Packard Co.

I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?

The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?

(Around 5 MB.)\n\nI have a Quadra 950. \nI have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.\n         (using block-mode transfers)\nI have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can\n         achieve 6.8 MB/s.\n\nLet\'s say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.\n\nIt is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,\nthen transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s\nresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)\n\nSo I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, \n\nStep 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.\nStep 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.\n        ...\nStep n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.\nStep n+1: Send the nth MB out card.\n\nEven though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,\nand the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho\')\neach of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were\nexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.\n\nWhy?\n\nIs the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both\naccess data at the same time.)\nIs the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use\nthe same bus to mac RAM?\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n--David\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| David Blume            | "I get tired thinking of all the things I  |\n| dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don\'t want to do."  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\n'

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

(As usual, the current edition of\nthe Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the\npriest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be\nrequired.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.  Note that while a Catholic priest is required\nfor Catholics, the Catholic church does recognize marriage between\nbaptized non-Catholics as valid without a priest.  --clh]\n'

11 b'From: shd2001@andy.bgsu.edu (Sherlette Dixon)\nSubject: Was Jesus Black?\nOrganization: BGSU\nLines: 43\n\nThe people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly,\ntoo arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to\nsee any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\nwasn\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

14 b'From: jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas)\nSubject: What\'s in a name?: the sequel\nOrganization: Kulikauskas home\nLines: 57\n\nI\'ve been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, \nI think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of \netymology.  I\'ve been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ\' and \n`Christian\'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn\'t a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn\'t disown me but they didn\'t completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn\'t come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, "As far as I\'m concerned, you still are a Jew." \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I\'ll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don\'t have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don\'t like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn\'t assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \nChristian\' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. \n\nJayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org\n'

This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.

If you want \'meaning\'\nwhy not just join a cult, such as in Waco? The leaders will give you\nthe security blanket you desire.\n\nlarry henling   lmh@shakes.caltech.edu\n'

I\'d be interested in the cost per megabyte and the\n>approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.\n\nI think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).\nIt is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest\ndrives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

[However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

6 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Clipper Launch Article\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 40\n\nTo All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..\n  \nFrom the March 1993 "Aero Vision" (The newsletter for the Employees\nof McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).\n  \n  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY\n  \n  "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.\n  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.\n  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and\n  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed\n  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force\n  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for\n  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were\n  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria\n  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the\n  cafeteria.\n  \n  Quest\'s Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the\n  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the\n  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude\n  of 300 feet.

7 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. "I didn\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\'s orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,\nfaster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a\nlittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today\'s engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our\nparents\' time."\n\n        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. "It\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially."\n\n        SDIO\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction\nwe\'re going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\'s\nDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\'t\nsustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has."\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let\'s not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\'s build a spaceship!"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\'\nsenior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government\ninvestments."\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\n\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has\na technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible\nfor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.\n\n\n'

I originally\nwrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone\nhere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but\nare missing some higher-level functionality.  They\'re intended more as an\nintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.\n\n*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it\n*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I\'ll make the mods and re-post it as a\n*** different version.\n\nThe routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They\nare fairly simple, but I\'ve found them to be very fast (for my purposes,\nanyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a\n"virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with\nno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy\nareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I\'ve also included a\nsimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256\ncolor GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick\'n\'dirty(tm) demo program\nthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".\n\nThe whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip \nIt is zipped with pkzip 2.04g\n\nIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I\'m concerned.  Do with\nit whatever you like.  However, it\'d be nice to get credit where it\'s due,\nand maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don\'t like it don\'t bother)\n\nMark\nmorley@camosun.bc.ca\n'

Basically, you look into a room that looks\nsimilar to the following:\n\n                             xxxx\n                         xxxxx   xxxx\n                     xxxx    x       xxxx\n                 xxxx        x           xxxx\n             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx\n             x           xxxx    xxxx           x\n             x       xxxx            xxxx       x\n             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x\n             xxxx              3 /|\\         xxxx\n                 xxxx            /~\\     xxxx\n                     xxxx            xxxx\n                         xxxx    xxxx\n                             xxxx\n\nThe good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move\naround in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]\n\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two\'s rising edge has a slope\nof 1/4. (I\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).\n\nI\'ve run into two problems; I\'m sure that other readers have tried this\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\n\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the "jaggies."  I\'m\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\n\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\nshape?\n\nCurrently I take:\n\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n\nand produce:\n            \n             1  2  3  4\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\n                                    61 62 63 64\n\nLine 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.\nLine 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.\nThis fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But\nit causes distortions.

This is why there appears to\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\'t have to\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I\'ve decided that this\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\na real perspective drawing.\n\nHopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\n-- \nTill next time,                \\o/   \\o/\n                                V \\o/ V     email:pinky@tamu.edu\n<>  Sam  Inala  <>                 V\n\n'

This is\n  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had\n  any problems with it.\n\n  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than \n  a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better \n  suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non\n  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.\n  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear\n  changes.\n  \n  The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike\n  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a\n  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect\n  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced \n  by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up\n  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better\n  ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.\n\n  So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,\n  which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.\n\n"

Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine\noptics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with\nstrap can be added..call it $7 more.\n \nVivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285\neclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.\n$30.\n \nUniversal "Roamer 63" folding old "bellows" camera with leather case.\nUses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter\nrelease.  Decent shape.  $20.\n \nWeston 540 lightmeter.

This is the little\n(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,\nbut try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with\nsplit image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.\n \nOlympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm\nlens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I\nthink this was the predecessor to the XA - and it\'s nearly all metal.\nI won\'t mind holding onto this one if it doesn\'t sell.  $60.\n \nOlympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and\nTokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to\nmint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film\nadvance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact,\nand sharp lens.  $225 for the set.\n \n \nThat\'ll do to clean out some of the stuff.

Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\'s. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\'s minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development."\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

Yes\n(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 \nrunning at 15.87 Mhz.\n(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a \nlot of memory.\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \nthe Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine \nCalifornia is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - \n$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that \nare selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.\n(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an \naverage access time of about 25 ms.\n(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a \nbacklit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move \nyour head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or \nnon-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.\n\nOther things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay \nfor it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to \nsell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about \n$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for \nabout $900. \n\nThe answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.\n\nI'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got \none they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright\n\n--\n  gene@theporch.raider.net (Gene Wright)\ntheporch.raider.net  615/297-7951 The MacInteresteds of Nashville\n"

You might have\nto pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  Look on the\nstreet under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt,\nor even around Gate 1.  The later you buy them, the less money you'll pay,\nand during the regular season you could usually find some for near face\nvalue or below if you wait until game time.

The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Since I\'ve addressed these issues in this\nnewsgroup in the not too distant past, I won\'t go into them again now.\n\nWhat is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the\nimpression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps\neven the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around\nhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and\npetty hatreds.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\'s special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\'t work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can\'t go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\'t tell you all the things I\'ve tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.\n-- \nGary H.

I purposely used "handle" in order to \navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\naberrations like "scientific" creationism).  I used "best" in part to indicate \nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written "how and when".  Nobody\nseems to argue over what.\n\n>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the "who and \n>why" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or \n>agnostics.\n\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\'m not\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \nthink the masses can\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \nincapable; they just don\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \ndispensing answers to "who and why".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \nthe "truth" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as "real" as scientific facts and \nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \n\n>Do you suggest that the "who and why" will forever be closed to scientific \n>investigation?\n\nNo.  In fact, I don\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \nIsn\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\'t\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\'s a tough one for\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \nconvoluted here; I hope I\'ve made sense.  \n\n>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on\n>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.\n\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \nnaturalists\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\n\n>|>Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota\n\n>Did like your discussion around AMHs, and I did figure out what AMH was from\n>your original post :-)\n\nMuch obliged.

One of the early arguments against the project were that the \nresources would be better used to focus on specific genetics-related \nproblems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence.  \nThe project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though.\n"

OldPos 11 | 3 b"From: edw@boi.hp.com (Edward Walsh)\nSubject: Guzzi 850-T tires, plus fairing question\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard / Boise, Idaho\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\nLines: 59\n\n\n\n\nI have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

It has been reported previously\nand there is a fix.  Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters\nare used immediately preceding the equation frame.  The work around when\nequations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one\npreceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where\nplaced w/no text wrap around).  Unforutnately, once the page run-on has\noccured you are hosed.

As an example, it says \'The serial port can be changed to\nCOM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.\' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(\n\nThere are 2 banks of jumpers.

The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer\nport as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the "G" enables the game port and\nthe "S2" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can\'t get it to work. I\nhave tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that\nthis bank must tell the card which IRQ\'s to use for both ports, but I don;t\nknow how.

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

Any info or experience anyopne has would be\ngreatly appreciated.\n\nWhen I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types\nof sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH\nspeakers:\n\nsystem beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)\n\nArmor Alley\nSpectre\nSpaceward Ho!\n\n\nBut, the following games only play out of the left channel:\n\nLemmings\nOut of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\nGlider 4.0\nOIDS\n\n\nBut still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers.\n(The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which\nmy roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))\n\n\nAll of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run\nOOTW because he doesn't have color).\n\nWe're both running system 7.1\n\n\n\nDoes anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get\nsound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or\ngreater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?\n\nI used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in\nstereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be\nmistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB\n170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there\nisn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are\napparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they\ncould just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of\nboth speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?\n\nQuadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),\nso maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1\npatch over this problem?)\n\n\n\n\nThanks for any help you can provide!\n\n\nDoug Book\ndpb@sdchemw2.ucsd.edu\n"

We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\'ve ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\'ll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\n\n\nDan Snodgrass\nMedia Services\nLewis & Clark College\nPortland\n'

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I\'d like to\nask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a\nmarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at\nthis point.  Well, my group\'s plan is to market a "full page" monitor\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology\'s PaletteBook\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height. \nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\napplications, color screens aren\'t really a neccessity.  We could\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\n\nNow, please don\'t write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\nvia email and let me know:\n1. If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\n3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea\n\nAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,\nbut who knows!), please send me some.\n\nThanks in advance!!!\n\n-Mike\n'

(As usual, the current edition of\nthe Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the\npriest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be\nrequired.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

Presbyterian\nand Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical\nlanguages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral\nprogram in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But\nthere are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the\nattitude seems to be more, "Well, if you\'re *really* interested we\'ll give you\na semester-long course, but we don\'t understand why . . .")\n\nThe pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year\nstudents to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each\nlanguage, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (That is: Hebrew in\nAugust, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.) \nThese courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students,\nI\'d say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work.\n'

Gradually,\nhowever, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a\nstrictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both\nthe state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was\nreally conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no\ngreater moral or religious implications than if I had been\nconducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,\nto "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion). \n\n     I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp\ndistinction between marriage before God, and "marriage" before\nthe state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.

I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on\nthe Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on\nthe PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware\nahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing\nhas allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.\n\nIn general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides\nare set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the\nPS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.\nWhen I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.\nI can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the\ntransmission is error free.\nBut straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.\nUnless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human\ntyping. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).\n\nI would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files\nfrom a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please\ntell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am\ntalking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some\nkind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.\n\nRight now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because\nof the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds\nbecause of some crazy reason I don't understand.\n\nCould I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information\nout the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a\nsys-ex dump?\n\nCould anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.\nI wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,\nor just me.\n\nYes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type\nback and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking\nand CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also,\nAccording to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.\n\nPlease help me figure out what's going on...\n\nScott Petrack\nPetrack@haifasc3.vnet.ibm.com\n\n"

Yes\n(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 \nrunning at 15.87 Mhz.\n(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a \nlot of memory.\n(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors \nthat still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors \nsell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell \nmemory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most \nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \nthe Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine \nCalifornia is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - \n$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that \nare selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.\n(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an \naverage access time of about 25 ms.\n(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a \nbacklit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move \nyour head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or \nnon-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.\n\nOther things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay \nfor it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to \nsell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about \n$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for \nabout $900. \n\nThe answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.\n\nI'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable?

I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor\nvideo card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am\nrunning Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping\nthe program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure\nis very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,\nvery slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.\n\nThe HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it\ndoes not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this\nslow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there\nsomething else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?\n\nThanks.\n\n(You can mail to me directly if you wish, at genek@cs.ucsb.edu).\n'

It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get\n   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I\n   was told by a police officer.\n2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to\n   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns\n   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.\n3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will\n   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.\n   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form\n   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  \n   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these\n   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will\n   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess\n   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.\n4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will\n   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations\n   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \nno idea how the human body interacts with it\'s environment and how that \nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn\'t help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI\'ve been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That\'s okay because I \nknow that some of what I\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few "enlightened" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\'s really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\'t cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with "good" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with "good" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine\'s doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to "treat" it.\nIf it\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane "barrier".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\'s die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a "good" bacterial flora in the body and/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\'s name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\'s nice to know that I don\'t have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from "Natural Healing" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\'s not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor\'s use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart\'s content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn\'t have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107\n\n"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance".\n'

Additionally, it is hard to say\nwhat type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say\nhow long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for\nmonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are \nevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.\nAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start\nazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug\nin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics\nabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of \ndisease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it\nis worth.  \n\nI treat patients with UC and Crohn's.

The socio-economic factors which we know help \nto produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large \nproportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we\nsomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is \nlaid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have.

No, that has \nsocioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a \ndysfunction.\n\nBasically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that\nsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to\ndeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african\namericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem.

OldPos 4879 | 18 b'From: banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu\nSubject: How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation\nLines: 154\nNntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu\nOrganization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nI got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I\'m going to state it again here.\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\n\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \nper day).\n\n\t1. Review Article "Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \n\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\n\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\n\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\n\n\t2. "Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \n\t    patients with kidney stones" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\n\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \n\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\n\n\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria" Clin. Sci. 38\n\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \n\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\n\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \nbefore supplementation.\n\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don\'t know about \nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \nin urinary oxalate excretion.\n\n\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\n\n\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\n\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\n\n\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \n\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\n\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\n\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn\'t \nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \n\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \nformation should be given B6 supplements.\n\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \ncalcium-oxalate.\n\n\t4. "The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \npatients with calcium oxalate calculi"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)\n\n\t5. "Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the \ncrystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium \ninteraction"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).\n\n\t6.Review Article, "Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment \nof renal calcium stones" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\n\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I \nguess that he doesn\'t read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney \nstones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought \nI\'d tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor\'s office.\n\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 W. 17th Street\nTulsa, Ok. 74107\n\n"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance".

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Hawking, whose theories attempt to\nexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate\ndimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, "because while\nI\'m most interested in those things in space that are farther\naway, I know that here is where the first steps are taken."\n     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate\nstudents and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,\nas David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of\nFlight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer\'s project\nscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.\n     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid\nto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should\nextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,\nthey would find a variety of images that would explain something\nof Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with\nthe spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.\n     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes\ndescribing the project and the spacecraft\'s features. In answer\nto a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed\ndrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it\'s only\na concept." Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five\nyears before, described the professor as "a living miracle of the\npower of the brain. He\'s miraculous, and he has such a good sense\nof humor."\n     The next stop, a demonstration on scientific data\nvisualization in Section 384\'s Digital Image Animation Lab,\nentertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles\nto view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong\nshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been\ndiscovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about\nits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he\nasked several questions on their interpretation.\n     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data\nAcquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations\nFacility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.\n     The day ended with two technical discussions of particular\ninterest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank\nEstabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described\na three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.\nThen planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the\nphilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.\n     The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern\nCalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and\nplanned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab\ntour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promised\nChahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.\n                          ###\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.

Drag free may already have\nbeen flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would\nmore accurately respond to motions from the Earth\'s gravity field and\nignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball\nfloating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little\nadjustment jets to keep the ball away from them.
