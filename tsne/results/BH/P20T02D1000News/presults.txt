I don\'t argue\nthat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I\njust question whether you >should<.\n\nThe fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we\ncan\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That\nhas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human\nperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t\nthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather\nthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.\n\nI guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models\nthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I\nreally hope I do, but I\'m not holding my self-similar breath.\n\n> There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal\n> image compression.\n\nUh huh.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  I\'ve been chasing fractal\ncompression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so\ngreat, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t,\nI\'ll wager.\n\nActually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression\nwork- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable\nalternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)\n\nI\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I\ndon\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is\npractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their\nsleeves that make their demos work, but I don\'t see anyone using it in a\nreal product.  It\'s been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,\nright?\n\n\t"There are always going to be questions until there\'s a product\n\tout there," Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first\n\tencoding devices in the summer, he says.

Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic\n>phil. of sci. texts as an example of the inventive component of\n>hypothesizing. \n\nAnd has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-\nBernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

I would offer some rather well known examples\nsuch as Toricelli\'s Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air"\nhypothesis.

Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)\nout of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and\nwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.\nThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty\nat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, one\ncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new\ndomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you\nlike.\n-- \nGary H.

However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

But how culturally & biblically accurate are\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\n\nSherlette \n\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  "It doesn\'t matter what\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\nsaying that "it doesn\'t matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipated\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\nMATTERS.\n\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\'t discuss\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\'t been\ndiscussed recently shouldn\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\'t be\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\'s also good now and then\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\n'

The Bible "ends"\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God\'s reign end there ?

This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,\ntreasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely\nAfrican.

However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid\nany ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\ntheir commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public\ncommitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular\nmarriage.  Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.

The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My\napologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

2 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

In other\nwords, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,\nnavigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. \nYou wouldn\'t want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I\'d hate to see\nfolks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch\nsystem comes on line.\n\nI guess I\'d simplify this to say that \'waste\' is a slippery concept.  If\nyour goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its\nnot \'wasted\' money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500\nmillion, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.\n\nCraig\n\n\nCraig Keithley           |"I don\'t remember, I don\'t recall, \nApple Computer, Inc.     |I got no memory of anything at all"\nkeithley@apple.com       |Peter Gabriel, Third Album (1980)\n'

17 b"From: szabo@techbook.com (Nick Szabo)\nSubject: SSF Redesign: Constellation\nSummary: decentralize & automate functions\nKeywords: space station, constellation\nArticle-I.D.: techbook.C51z6E.CL1\nOrganization: TECHbooks --- Public Access UNIX --- (503) 220-0636\nLines: 89\n\nSSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

I was just wondering if we could have some kind\n>of update on DC-X.\n\nWell it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting\nready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out\nof town (in NM).\n\nAs for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work\non SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have\nsome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital\nprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for\nanother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with\nmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a\nset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.\n\nBetter news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of\nthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next\nyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.\n\nNow not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made\nfor spending half on DC.\n\nPublic support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I\'ll\nhelp you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local media\nans get them to cover the flight tests.\n\n   Allen\n-- \n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Lady Astor:   "Sir, if you were my husband I would poison your coffee!"   |\n| W.

I\'m >philosophically< opposed to it\nbecause of its complexity.\n\nThis complexity has led to some programs\' poor TIFF writers making\nsome very bizarre files, other programs\' inability to load TIFF\nimages (though they\'ll save them, of course), and a general\ninability to interchange images between different environments\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\n\nAs the saying goes, "It\'s not me I\'m worried about- it\'s all the\n>other<  assholes out there!"  I\'ve had big trouble with misuse and\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\n\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\nemphasis mine):\n\n"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\nand that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\nimage-generating applications out there now."\n\n\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can\'t read >every< TIFF\nimage, that means there are some it won\'t- some that I might have to\ndeal with.

Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay??\nI know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose\nun-important, but I still can't help be curious!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nIvan Thomas Barr \n\nContact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk\n\n[The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is\nabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.\nThe prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do\nsome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that\nsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are\ndebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \n\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\n\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\nCentury.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the\nother.\n\n--clh]\n"

The critical information from the neuron is in\nthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per\nseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the\nsignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit\nconvertor is more then sufficient.\n\nAC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases\nyou are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled\nalso. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If\nthe cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly\ndistorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the\noccurrence of the spike that is important. \n\nHowever, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start\nbattling with the toolbox to get it going.

However, it\'s still a heck of a machine for the price -- it\nis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It\'s probably the\nmost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)\n\n        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and\nhere\'s what he told me:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is what is included:\n        - TCD-D3 DATman.\n        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for\n          analog output.\n        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).\n        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The\n          unit is still under factory warrantee.\n        - AC adaptor/battery charger.\n        - Rechargable battery.\n\nI paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don\'t mind if I keep the 60 minute\ntape it came with (I have some samples on it!).\n\n[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he\'s including an\n extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about\n $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5\n years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        I\'m not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.\nSend him mail and ask him what he wants.\n\n        Again, I\'ve used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly\nunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I\'ve been using one for a little\nwhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point\nout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and\nhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine\nthat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher\nConspiracy for their recent live album.)\n\n        Bryan Davis says:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels\nin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported\nproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        \'nuff said.\n\n        The reason I\'m not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don\'t have any\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn\'t.  (I am also paying more\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\n\n        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,\nby the way.)\n\n        Anyway, if you\'re interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.\n\n-- \nJohn Davison\ndavisonj@ecn.purdue.edu\n'

OldPos 11191 | 10 b'From: tomh@metrics.com (Tom Haapanen)\nSubject: RFD: comp.os.ms-windows.nt.{misc,setup}\nOrganization: Software Metrics Inc.\nLines: 76\nNNTP-Posting-Host: rodan.uu.net\n\nThis is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two\nnew newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing\nthe one originally posted in January \'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\nproposed groups are described below:\n\nNAME: \t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\n\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\n\nNAME:\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\nSTATUS:\t Unmoderated.\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\n\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\n\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\n\nRATIONALE:\n\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\n\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\n\tto argue about the meaning of an "OS").  The family ranges from\n\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\n\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\n\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\n\tactual release is slated for May/June \'93.\n\n\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\n\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\n\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\n\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\n\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\n\tWindows 3.1.\n\n\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\n\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\n\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\n\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\n\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\n\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\n\n\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\n\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\n\t\n\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\n\twell as Windows 3.1:\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\n\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\n\t\n\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\n\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\n\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\n\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\n\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\n\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\n\n\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\n\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\n\tgeneration Windows, "Chicago", debuts next year, surely it should\n\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\n\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\n\n\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\n\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \n\nVOTING:\n\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\n\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will\n\tbe accepted prior to the CFV.\n-- \n[ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ]\n[       "stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ]\n[          up.  that\'s how the corrado makes you feel."  -- car, january \'93 ]\n'

Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown\n    by the Graphite and #9GXE\'s "cheating".  Can\'t they just admit that\n    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach\n    is much harder to beat...\n\n2.  The big "cheat" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and\n    PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn\'t\n    do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing\n    PC Magazine says is that scores are not "legitimate" -- couldn\'t they\n    at least make some comment about its real-world performance?\n\nI\'m not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve\nGibson\'s results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx\nDraw to benchmark).  If you believe Gibson, that is ... :)  He writes:\n\n    "Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world\n     applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than\n     any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  Even though it\'s\n     just a modest ISA bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter I\n     have, including the Stealth 24 VLB, the Fahrenheit 1280VA/VLB, the\n     ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000-based Diamond Viper VLB."\n\nThis kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus WinBench\nor not!  :)\n\n> When and if you get one send me mail..

I\'m now (temporarily) back to running an\noriginal ATI GU, until I get my Graphite.  And, yes, the GU is faster in\nmy 16 MB system than the GU+, especially in bitmap handling (that\'s where\nyou use BitBlits).\n\nHercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers: you\ncan buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for 50% off list to try it out.  At\njust $199 for Graphite or $249 for the VLB version I decided it was worth\ntrying (I\'m supposed to get the VLB board within two weeks).  I\'ll post\nmy impressions when I get it...\n\n-- \n[ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ]\n[       "stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ]\n[          up.  that\'s how the corrado makes you feel."  -- car, january \'93 ]\n'

The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple\'s unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25" device.  The service techs I talked to said, "Oh sure,\nwe stock those."  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that\'s of no use.\n\nI\'m going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.\n\n\t-Fred\n\n\n'

I can name a number of\ninterstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be\nvery optimistic in any car.\n\nI\'m not sure what you call "quite severe" in terms of road deviations\nbut I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be\nconsidered so.  They\'re hard to take at 85mph.  That\'s not the only\ninterstate I\'ve seen with such deviations, but it\'s one I drive\nfrequently.\n\nTexas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can\'t assume that everywhere\nhas roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such\nwide-open spaces.

See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.

Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).\n-- \nMark A.

Here are some observations gained from\npainful experience:\n\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\n\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\n     that these things will itch for months.\n\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\'s special\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\n     required to get it.\n\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\'t work.  I recall\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\n\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\n     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\n     up on weekends since I literally can\'t go outside where we\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\n     apparently don\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\n\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\'t tell you all the things I\'ve tried.\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\n     it gains nothing).\n\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\n     as well.\n\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\ndoctors apparently don\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\nwould make a *lot* of money.\n-- \nGary H.

Such "extra-\n>rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\n\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\n\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\nlarge part of the history of science.\n\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\n\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\n\n(I wouldn\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\nI don\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\n\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\nfunction of science: results don\'t count unless they can be replicated.\n\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\n\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\'s irrational motivation had\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\n\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\nthink supports their position (creationists).\n-- \nMark A.

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat\nuncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "progress" and\n"rationality" in science.  Since I\'ve addressed these issues in this\nnewsgroup in the not too distant past, I won\'t go into them again now.\n\nWhat is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the\nimpression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps\neven the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around\nhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and\npetty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that\nsciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the\ncontext in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational\nand even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then\nweeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this critical\nfunction should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.\nIf experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are\nsubject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true\nof the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.\nThis is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)\n\nTrue, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is\n*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have\nresulted in some way from a dream or from one\'s political views simply\ndo not generalize well to the actual history of science.\n-- \nGary H.

If you are really\nworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense\nof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best\nthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.

I\'d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,\nnot design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc.

In most of this thread, I have\nbeen concerned with the difference between what is science and\nwhat is not. \n\nLee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between\nEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of\ntheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a\ngenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts\nare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or\nKorzybski as examples.  If you don\'t like these, choose your\nown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre\nphysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and\nthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the\ncumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.\nBoth Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to\ndo this.  \n\nLet me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked\nto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many\nkinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is\nthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\none that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the\none that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. \n\n> If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\n> to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\n> But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.

Let\'s face it: we cannot\nalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything\nclear for us.

It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.\n\tso I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on \n \tmy PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.\n\n\tConfigurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS\n\tor NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.\n\n\tObject oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have\n\tto re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch\n\tor my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.\n\nIn other words it should have some AI capability.

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

I use mainly WordPerfect 5.1 (see next\npost) for which I got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the \nOkidata 180 in Epson FX mode. \n\nWhen I got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (I got mine\nfrom Tenex brand new - for a Christmas present).  I would like to get about\n$100 or so for it.  If you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring\n(E-Mail) and make an offer.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n'

They\nalso give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in PostScript\nenvironments where it is absent.\n\nThe suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints\nof a line using the following formula for each coordinate:\n\n\tnew_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25\n\t\nDoing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  From\nreading I thought that what they might actually do is:\n\n\tnew_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25\n\t\nThis results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" \nwhichever is closer.\n\nBy doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that\nneither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS\nresult looks better than how my stuff looks, I\'d like to know if\nanyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.\n\nThanks,\n\n--Steve\nsqueegee@world.std.com\n\n'

However, I don't know anyone who has\none.  I have my eye on two choices.\n\nDexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks\nsoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software\nCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.\n\nMustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales\n(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169\nmail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.\n\nI am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It\nis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400\ndpi) and price ($149).  \n\nBasically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that\nLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the\nbest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP\nLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the\nMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of\nprices.  Which should I buy?\n\nIf you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would\nrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range\n(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help\nwould be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Kevin Harter\n"

A continuous conductor is a good \nelectrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need\nshielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic\nfields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,\nlike a Faraday cage.\n\nThe flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,\nyou could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.\nYou aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be a\nreal problem (one that bit me once).\n\n"

Where I\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\nexceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\ncanon law retains this, but I\'d rather see a more recent and\nauthoritative source.

However, the "gifted one" can\n>only hear himself speaking in his own language.\n>\n\nThere seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which\nare problematic.  It\'s use as prayer language seems especially troubling\nto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing\nthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is\nGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go\nby the Pentecost use where it\'s an actual language.\n\nMoreover, the phrase "though I speak with the tongues of men and angels"\nused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then\nassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it\nis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.\n\nHmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how\nGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that\nif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one\namongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.\n\nSo why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE\nANOTHER?  It\'s disturbing to think that some people find ways to \njustify jabbering.\n\nBut I\'ll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.\n\nTrouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at\nverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that\nthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright\nfabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post\nseems like a "friend of a friend" thing.  And linguistically, a two\nsyllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.\n\nMuch as many faith healers have trouble proving their "victories" (since\nmost ailments "cured" are just plain unprovable) and modern day\nressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that no\nmodern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.\n'

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\n\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \netymology. It may originally have meant "member of the tribe," as in the\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish ("hostile to a member of the tribe"). This meaning\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to "member of the priestly\ntribe" and perhaps to "priest" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the "Magoi" as one of\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, "gift"), is\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\npurity, or separation of the "mixture" of the two opposed principles of spirit\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as "chorus," from\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean "sing the magic song" (Nyberg, 1966) and\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\nthe Avestan term for "priest," athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \n(Gershevitch, 1964).\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati ("head of the Magi"). During\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad ("the high priest of\nhigh priests") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\nhierarchy.\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\nof Central Asia.\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or "Ahrimanical," animals (khrafstra)\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\nthat of the priesthood: white.\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\nfor teaching the prince the "magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes" and thus\nthe "cult of the gods." Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\nmaster of himself.\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\nlike "goes," "expert in the magic arts" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, "the law-abjuring\ndaivas"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\npriesthood, would be very strange.\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu ("beneficent\nspirit") and Angra Mainyu ("hostile spirit") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\'s treachings, as well as in\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.\n\nSAOSHYANT:\n  The Avestan term saoshyant ("future benefactor"; MPers., soshans) designates\nthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.\nThe concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-\nastrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.\nZarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-\nshyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present\nstate of the world, when existence will be "rehabilitated" and "made splendid."\n[See Frashokereti]\n  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological\nmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors\nare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in\nLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),\nprotected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited\nSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta ("he who embodies truth"), the son of\nthe Vispataurvairi ("she who conquers all"), is the third, who will make\nexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will\nno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted\nunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will\nbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the\npowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and\nof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and\nrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with\nthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.\n  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation\n(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, "he who makes\ntruth grow," and Ukhshyatnemah, "he who makes reverence grow"; the names of the\nthree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra\nwhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally\nspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a\nmillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will\nappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.\n  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid\nperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element\nin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining\nfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the\nconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,\nMaitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace\nits roots to the same source.\n'

OldPos 1159 | 10 b'From: JEK@cu.nih.gov\nSubject: etymology of "Easter"\nLines: 53\n\nfor SRC\n\nIn most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is\nknown as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word\nwhich comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning "Passover." In English,\nGerman, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,\nor some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the\norigin of this term.\n\nOne explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE\nRATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an\nAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\nnot make it more so.\n\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply "Spring\nFestival."\n\nHowever, Bede\'s is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\nKnoblech, in "Die Sprach," ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\n\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\nof the Resurrection was known as "hebdomada alba" (white week),\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\nreferred to simply as "albae." Translaters rendering this into\nGerman mistook it for the plural of "alba," meaning "dawn." They\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\n"dawn." This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n\n\n[No, I\'m not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety\nof celebrating Easter.  However this seems like it contains enough\ninteresting information that people might like to see it.  --clh]\n'

It uses freon jets for\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\n\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I\'m speaking\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\n\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \nquantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I\'ll try to get you\nin touch with our ground crew people.\n\nCheers,\nCraig\n\n--\nDON\'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!\n'

This way I can get the speed when\nI want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any\ncompatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able\nto switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch\nwithout any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed\nand put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further\nreduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course\nI would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch\nbut use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and\nroute it directly to the mother board.\n\nI haven't started probing around inside my si yet.

It shouldn\'t reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM\nSIMMs, though.\n\n>\tOne last question!

The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple\'s unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25" device.  The service techs I talked to said, "Oh sure,\nwe stock those."  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that\'s of no use.\n\nI\'m going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.\n\n\t-Fred\n\n\n'

I can\'t\n: see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,\n\nre: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93\n\nThis article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2\nor DOS apps not running under Windows.\n\nOne of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that\ntheir RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost\neveryone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)\ndiscovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept\nan incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry\nerrors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or\nFAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer\nthan with the old 2400bps modem.\n\n\nThere are three reasons for the problem:\n\n1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most\n   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the\n   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high\n   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and\n   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded\n   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can\'t.\n\n2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and\n   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely\n   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you\n   are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a\n   16550". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance\n   about this issue,  you\'ll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the\n   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve\n   my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn\'t even\n   know what a UART was.\n\n3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2\'s do), or if you can upgrade\n   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience\n   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers\n   don\'t take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this\n   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications\n   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem\n   by themselves.\n\nIf you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of\nthe card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid\noverrunning it; however, I wouldn\'t want to bet that the card designers\nwere that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem\ncard.  Some modem cards don\'t even have conventional UARTs, but if they\nare to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.\nUse MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.\n\n\nThe Hardware Situation.\n\nThe UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250\nor Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can\'t replace\nthem).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft\ndiagnostic program \\WINDOWS\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*\nbringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from\naccurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.\n\nThe Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with\nconfigurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to\n460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there\'s no point in\npushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access\ncycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but\nit is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,\nsee National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.\n\nSo, what UART component do you have?\n\nTry to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM\nboard or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can\'t find a socketed component with\nthe numbers "8250" or "16450", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,\nand you won\'t be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE\nyour VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket\nCOM board.\n\nIf you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in\nNs16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several\nsuppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The "N" chip is the normal 40-pin\ndual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550\nchips without the "A" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).\n\nEarly Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those\nof their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various\nIC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states\nsupport for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:\nNational Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552\nChips&Technology:       82C607\nTexas Instruments:      t16c550a\nSilicon Systems:        73M550\nVLSI                    16C550\nTurboCom warns about the pre-"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,\nsays that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70\nsystems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).\n\nIf you DON\'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you\'ll need to buy an after-\nmarket COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you\nmay be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you\'ll need to\neither disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to\nCOM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).\n\nAlthough cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the\nproblem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology\nMCT-AIO+ card from:\n\nJDR Microdevices\n2233 Samaritan Drive\nSan Jose  CA  95124\n(800) 538-5000 voice US\n(408) 559-1200 voice other\n(800) 538-5005 FAX US\n\nThe MCT-AIO+ (and the "+" is important) sells for $89.95.  It is an 8-bit\nISA card providing:\n\nPort Type  Connector  Address and IRQ        Comments\nCOM        DB9M       COM 1,2,3 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket\nCOM        ribbon     COM 2,3,4 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket\nParallel   DB25F      LPT1,2,3  IRQ 5,7\nGame       ribbon\n\nThe kit includes a ribbon cable and DB25F connector for the secondary COM\nport, a ribbon cable/connector for the game port, two bulkhead plates for\nthe ribbon-based connectors and a 9F-to-25F adaptor cable.  Each port can\nbe individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR,\nDCD, and DSR jumpers.\n\nJDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.\n\nI have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards\nwith 16550s:\n\nTSD Systems\n(407) 331-9130\n$19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.\n\nGreenfield Trading and Distributors\n(518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX).\nTheir card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.\n\nR&S DATA SYSTEMS, INC.\n820 East Highway 434\nLongwood, FL  32750\nPHONE: (407) 331-1424\nFAX: (407) 331-8606\n2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39\n\nI have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports,\nand am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based\n8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set\nthe internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.\n\n\nThe Software Situation\n\nSimply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun\nproblems.  The standard MS serial drivers don\'t take full advantage of the\n16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1\ndrivers have the following limitations:\n - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.\n - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt\n   rate of 10x during uploads.\n - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it\'s easy for 2\n   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).\n - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.\n   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1\n   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would\n   be effective.\n - The API won\'t accept rates above "CBR_128000".\n - The API won\'t let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even\n   if it did, DOS programs that aren\'t 16550-aware get little benefit\n   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.\n - They don\'t allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.\n - The BIOS doesn\'t initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.\n - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don\'t provide port\n   speed options above 19200 bps.\n\nThese problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may\nor may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).\nRumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "4.0".\n\nYou can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying\na copy of "TurboCom", current version 1.2, from:\n\nBio-Engineering Research\nPacific CommWare Division\n180 Beacon Hill Lane\nAshland  OR   97520-9701\n(503) 482-2744 voice\n(503) 482-2627 FAX\n(503) 482-2633 BBS\nMCImail:    344-5374\nCompuServe: 71521,760\n\nPrice was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit\ncards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom\nbut as far as I know, they don\'t stock it.  Bio is not a software company\nper se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for\nan in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a\nmarket for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They\nrecently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.\n\nI now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my\ndatacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely\nsee transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps\nwhen linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.\nUploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts\nare still using antique UARTs and drivers.\n\nNote that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu\nin Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets\naround this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will\nset the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the\nWindows APIs and dialog boxes.\n\nI also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you\ndo the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is\nnot a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)\nstandard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another\n16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving\nsystem or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough\nto let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm\nengineer has informed me that the 16550\'s can\'t really do CTS/RTS all\nby itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above\n115,200 may still be risky.\n\nEven with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still\nexperience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and\nserious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to\nbuy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a\n16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of\nTurboCom, can be found in the Feb\'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine.\nI suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with\nprocess priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose\nthrashing system still runs into comm problems.\n\n\nClosing Soapbox Comments\n\nThe state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across\nthe computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,\nthe job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be\nassigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer\ncompanies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years\nbehind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation\nvendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the\ninitial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was\nsubsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the\nexception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent\nI/O.\n\nYou may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this\nsituation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect\ncries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs "sort of"\nwork today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a\nhardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that\nuse that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.\n\nRegards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road\nBob Niland                                        Suite 503\nInternet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525\nCompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209\n\n                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and\nstarted to experience these problems.\n\nApple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of\npotential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware\n(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power\nmanager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.\n\nNone of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe\n(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I\nhave no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears\nto help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on\nstartup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is\nbeing corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don\'t have any\nnon-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be\nreset by "holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up" -\nApple\'s advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button\nI\'m not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if\nsomeone can decipher Apple\'s advice for me.\n\nBeyond this Apple suggest that " you should follow the technical\nprocedures to check the hardware of this Duo". Since so many others\nappear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there\nhas been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -\nand quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230\npurchasers who have this problem.\n\nAny more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,\nparticularly Apple Duo engineers :-)\n\ncheers\n\nbrucet\n\n-- \n          bruce tulloch sydney australia - brucet@extro.ucc.su.oz.au\n***complex problems have straight forward, easy to understand wrong answers***\n'

This disables the auto-answer \nfunction of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra\n14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.\n\nIn Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \nthe histories I\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\nis possible that the histories I\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\nit - would it be in Hitler\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \n\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \n1920\'s.\n\n>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,\n>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered\n>tainted evidence. \n\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\'ve read), I\'d like to know \nwhat tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \n1920\'s and 30\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \ntime and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\n\n>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,\n>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better\n>place when they departed, \n\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \n\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\'t you write them \nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\'t tell from \ntheir footnotes? I\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\'m not going to waste my time\ntrying to debunk someone\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\n\n>but concrete particulars are still no more than\n>more or less shrewd guesses.  \n>-- Diccon Frankborn\n\nGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\nconsidered "shrewd guesses"?\n\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\n\nI\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

A much more likely explanation\nis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because\nthe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the\nhistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation\nimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of\nthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course\nnot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the\nanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or\nbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun\nto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,\nbut I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.\n-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)\n"

Remember from stellar evolution that \nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\nthey don\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\'s) will be in the plane of the\ngalaxy.  \n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\nsuppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\ndisk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\'s an \nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\'t work, also.  As I\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\nthese characteristics.  \n        \n        I think that\'s all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows\nsomething that I don\'t know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of\ntaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\ndistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,\nblack holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It\'s a fun\nfield. \n        Complaints and corrections to: belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu or \npost here.  \n                                                        -jeremy\n\n        \n'

Simon P. Worden,\n                     The Deputy for Technology, SDIO\n                                    \n                  Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach\n                              April 3,1993\n\n     Most of you, as am I, are "children of the 1960\'s."  We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - "you\'ve lost it!"  The "me" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened\nto your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn\nV\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!\n\n     This project is real.  The torch of American technological\ngreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is\nAmerican.  Let\'s go fly it!\n'

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\'ve made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation\'s experts to teach us\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\'s first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\'s ICBM\'s didn\'t take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\'t cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\'s to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\'s. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\'d just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn\'t spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\'s the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\'t\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\'t keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\'s\nand 1960\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\ndecade long programs.]\n\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\'s idea -- Any Takers?\n'

These have been popular, especially in Europe,\nto treat "capillary fragility", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--\na few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he\'d\nhad hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,\nI asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active\ningredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical\nsputtering.  I have no idea how he\'s doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.\nThe studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in\nhuman disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the\nreports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.\n\nThis stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there\'s\nlittle risk of trying it, but I wouldn\'t expect much of a result.\n\n-- \nSteve Dyer\ndyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer\n'

These aren\'t, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term\ndenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The\nrockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to\ndistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made\nammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines\nwith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A "D"\nengine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.\nAn "F" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a\ndoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size "O" are\navailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are\nshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of\nsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as\ncontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket\nengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)\n\nThere is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which\nholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities\n(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of\nRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved\nin HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and\ncompanies will not sell to uncertified individuals.\n\nBottom Line: It\'s legit.

It is, however, closely regulated. In order to \npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\none of the following:\na) An employee of a government agency.\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\n\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\n\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\n\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\'\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \n\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an "F" motor are exempt from\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\nC, for details.\n\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\n\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\n\n>And no, I\'m not going to even think of buying one.  I\'m not that crazy.\n\nWhy not? It\'s a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets\nfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything\nbigger) rocket hobbies.

Compared text 10855 : b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 81\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

OldPos 2 | 5 b'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\nLines: 82\n\n   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental\nBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental\nBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable \'frame\'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading\nsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\'s\ndelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\'s\natmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and "adds to the ozone supply."\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \'unit\' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian\'s questions:\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\'t piggy back upon\nsomeone else\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\'t think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don\'t really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\'s in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\'s the time\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\'t heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.  I don\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\nI don\'t THINK I do...).\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

Yes, I understand the issues.  I don\'t even\nparticularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the\nsort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must\nfind things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.\n\nA few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:\n\n\t1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it\nwould have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly\nlow orbit.\n\n\t2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?\nWhat real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical\nastronomers are *really* going to be impacted?\n\n\t3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of\n\'seeing\' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the\nsensors are supposed to return along with the data for large\ninflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?\nThe choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is\nbeing used to help fund this thing.\n\n\t4) If your answer to 3) above was "the astronomers", then feel\nfree to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more\nimportant research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING\nANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.\n\n>I guess we really\n>deserve being wiped out by uv radiation, folks. "Stupidity wins". I\n>guess that\'s true, and if only by pure numbers.\n\nProbably so.

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n'

OldPos 3803 | 10 b"From: szabo@techbook.com (Nick Szabo)\nSubject: SSF Redesign: Constellation\nSummary: decentralize & automate functions\nKeywords: space station, constellation\nArticle-I.D.: techbook.C51z6E.CL1\nOrganization: TECHbooks --- Public Access UNIX --- (503) 220-0636\nLines: 89\n\nSSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n\n-- \nNick Szabo\t\t\t\t\t szabo@techboook.com\n"

Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include\nattitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things\nlike thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro\ndata from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you\ndon't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible\ncontamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get\nto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is\ndone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for\nthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from\nthrusters and the like).\n\nThe original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the\nreboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well\nsuited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing\na lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was\nrelatively short, so it got cancelled.\n-- \nSVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\nbetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"
